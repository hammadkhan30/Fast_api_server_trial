For example, the axis helper controls the local axis of this element and can be toggled on and off from here. You can see the local axis of the pipe. Similarly, you can manage these settings for the entire model from here. If desired, you can turn the axis helpers on and off from here. The element access helpers can also be independently turned on and off. Additionally, if you have imported the process model, you can enable it here.\n\nIn the camera settings, you can change the perspective or orthographic view of the model. It is recommended to use the perspective view for better control over the model. That covers the camera settings.\n\nMoving on to the grid mat displayed at the bottom, it can be toggled on and off from here. You can control the spacing and the number of lines in each direction. For example, if you want two lines spaced one meter apart in each direction, you will get it like this. If you want 50 lines, each one meter apart, it will be displayed accordingly. Moreover, if you have a specific project-related grid setup, you can define user-defined grids. Let's say we have \"Grid Set One\" with X-axis grids at 0 meters, 5 meters, and 10 meters, named as A, B, and C, respectively. Along the Z-axis, we have 0 meters, 6 meters, and 12 meters. The grid names can be labeled as 1, 2, and 3. You can choose the starting point at 000 and determine the grid's direction in the X and Z axes. The grid will be created in the specified quadrant. This grid can serve as a basic project reference grid. You can generate multiple grids and manage them according to your needs. That's all about the grids.\n\nLastly, there is one more property related to analysis.

For that, we need to create a new file and start 3D modeling with the piping components. You have multiple menus available to perform various actions. The first step is to create the Python routing. If you are doing it manually, you need to add a row and fill in the required values.\n\nFor example, if I want to create a line at a 5-meter elevation or along the Z-axis for 10 meters, I simply enter the correct information, and the line will be drawn accordingly. The next line can start from the end of the previous pipe and move, for example, five meters in the plan at a 90-degree angle. This is how the lines are connected.\n\nThen I add the next line, starting from pipe 2, going 42 meters in elevation at a 90-degree angle. This is how the overall piping is created. Once the pipeline routine is created, we can define the cross-sectional parameters such as the diameter of the pipe. Let's say we choose 10 inches, schedule, standard, and material. This information can be exported and imported using CSV files. If you have the data ready from any CAD application, you can directly import it here through the CSV files. You simply export the CSV, update the data, and import it back.\n\nI will demonstrate this by exporting the data in CSV format, replicating the same information for the next pipes, and then importing it back into the product from the downloaded CSV file. This way, all the parameters are assigned to the respective pipes.\n\nIn addition, when creating the pipeline, we can assign line numbers for each section. For example, if we want the lines to be numbered as 1001, we can add another line that starts from the origin, goes to a certain elevation at X=2, and runs parallel to the previous line. By connecting it with the previous line, the line number is automatically assigned. You can define the length and direction of each line to create the entire pipeline routing in the model.\n\n\n\nHow can I create a pipeline routine in the piping product?\n\nTo create a pipeline routine in the piping product, you need to create a new file and start 3D modeling with the piping components.\n\n\n\nWhat are the steps involved in creating a pipeline routine?\n\nThe steps involved in creating a pipeline routine include creating the Python routing, adding rows and filling in the required values, specifying the cross-sectional parameters, and assigning line numbers to the pipeline sections.\n\n\n\nCan you explain the process of assigning line numbers to the pipeline sections?\n\nLine numbers are assigned to the pipeline sections to establish connectivity between them.

If we put a factor of 1, the calculated dead load based on the geometry will be applied to each element.\n\nWithin the loading section, we also have the option to apply insulation loads. We need to choose the specific pipe segment number, define the insulation thickness, and specify the density of the insulation. For example, we can set the insulation density as 200 kg/m\u00b3 and give it a name like \"insulation one.\" The next time we use this insulation, the density value will be automatically filled in. Once the insulation is applied, a transparent layer will be created around that pipe segment to indicate that it is insulated.\n\nAdditionally, we can apply additional loads on the pipe.

If we want to apply a point load of 50 kg at a distance of two meters, we can specify it as a point load. Alternatively, we can apply a UDL starting from two meters up to five meters with a value of, for example, five parameters.

So, first, we need to log in. As we all know, for piping, we obtain data from process data sheets and generate a piping model in CAD. If we can extract specific information in CSV formats, it will greatly reduce our work. For example, I have prepared a CSV with data for a model consisting of 50 lines, 50 pipes, and 11 lines. Let me show you a snapshot of how it looks. It may take some time to open, but once imported, we can see the line modeling data. We need to provide pipe numbers and line numbers in sequence. The central and elevation information is not necessary if we provide the start point and end point information. This is sufficient. However, if we are manually modeling it, this information helps us determine the length and direction of the line. If we have the start point and end point information directly from a CAD model, we can import it here. After importing, we can see the line models, and we need to define the pipe diameter and thicknesses as part of the design data, which we obtain from the process. Let me import the design data for the same model. I have prepared the CSVs so that I can simply import them. The data in these CSVs comes entirely from our process data sheets and defines the pipes. For some of the junctions, I will create end connectors, while others will remain as they are to show the difference. Here are the end connectors. Let me import them. The moment I import them, you can see a change in the way the pipes are connected. These end connectors, like PP25, are elbows with a 14-inch diameter standard and a material thickness of approximately 16.5 millimeters. You also have the option to make changes, such as using a multiple-segment microband or a single-segment microband. You can choose to keep it as it is. Similarly, we can provide flanges. Let me import the flanges data from the CSV again. This is how it looks. All the flanges are automatically filled in from the CSV to each pipe.\n\nNow, once we have generated our entire basic model, we can proceed to the loading stage. When it comes to loading, you need to enter some design data in the pipe data, specifically the TNP values. For example, let's say you have a 2-bar pressure in pipeline 1. Okay, I will make that entry. What is the line number? Alright, for line number 2, we will set it as PP6. In PP6, I have entered 2 bars of pressure, and the temperature is ambient only. Currently, I am not making an entry for temperature, so let's proceed. I have entered the value for PP6, and subsequently, the following pipelines will automatically inherit all the values I entered. If I make any changes to any of the intermediate pipelines, the same change will affect all the lines below it. That's how the data is linked. Therefore, we only need to input values where there are changes in temperature and pressure.\n\nOnce we have defined all these parameters, we can move on to the loading stage. Under loading, we can specify the dead loads, which include increasing the self-weight to consider the support loads and other factors. We can also add installation loads by specifying the weight. For example, you can give a thickness of 20 mm and a density of 100 kg per mm cube. Additionally, we can assign a name to it. Similarly, you can have additional loads on the pipes. If there are instrumentation moves or other fittings that you don't want to model, you can simply add their loads to the pipe. For PP6, you have a load at a distance of 2 meters from the start point, with a value of 5 kg. This is how you can incorporate dead loading. Similarly, you have the option to import slug load information from the process data sheet. You will need to define the pipe number, location (start or end), fluid density, velocity, and factor. The system will automatically calculate the slug load based on this information. For wind loads, you just need to define the wind parameters. The system will then calculate the wind loads for each pipe automatically. There's no need to calculate them manually outside the application.", "doc_id": "05cc778c-8c93-42c7-92ba-f0218aa379b3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1009b9ab89c999b48d02b81654722007acf0f6fbf87e4470e3174bb1a44026f2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4175, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4d81a287-56dd-4370-a10c-04c07d0e12ba", "3": "6fad6062-d3f2-42fe-8b95-2005dd2312e1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fad6062-d3f2-42fe-8b95-2005dd2312e1": {"__data__": {"text": "pipe automatically. There's no need to calculate them manually outside the application. Moreover, you can obtain all the natural frequencies of the pipes within the application. This demonstrates that mathematically your model is correct. Once again, since there are 11 lines, you will receive one natural frequency for each line. Thus, we have analyzed all the 11 lines for natural frequency. Moving on, we can proceed to load combinations and seismic analysis. In seismic analysis, we need to define the seismic parameters and generate the seismic loads.\n\nSimilarly, in the load combination, you also need to define load combinations that are familiar to your current regions. However, one can always make changes and add their own load combinations as they desire. So, that's all about load combinations. Moving on, we have load transfer to the structure. When transferring load to the structure, we consider various types of loads, such as empty loads, test loads, operating loads, thermal loads, wind decks, wind z, PSV surge load, and ice and snow loads. For these loads, you need to choose which load combinations should be considered when calculating the operating load or the thermal load. To do this, you simply need to select the specific load combinations. These are the vertical load combinations that the system takes into account when applying the operating load.\n\nNow, let's move on to the analysis. In piping, we set the design port and the discretization length limit. This means that the pipe will be divided into meter-long segments for analysis. For example, if I set it to one, the pipe will be split into one-meter pieces and then analyzed. In terms of reports, you will receive various types of information. It may take a little while, but in the meantime, let's have a look at the types of reports available. We have a reaction summary, design reports for each line separately, member forces, member stress checks, pipe thickness checks, node displacement, deflection checks, and the material takeoff. If you navigate to a specific section, let's say 9-1, it is still analyzing that particular section. Once the analysis of one line is completed, the results will start appearing. Let's wait for a moment. Here we have it. We have obtained reactions for lines 1-5.\n\nI think it's still processing for a second. So, for the first pipe, let's proceed with checking the results to see what has happened. We are currently looking at line number 1. Now, if we want to perform a member stress check for this line, we can choose a specific load combination and see how the line is stressed under that particular load. For example, if I select load combination number 101, we can observe that certain segments of the pipe are failing while others are passing. The last segment, indicated by the green color, has a stress ratio below 0.3. The red segments have a stress ratio above 1, and the yellow segments have a stress ratio between 0.3 and 1. This color-coded representation helps us interpret the results.\n\nMoving on, we also have the thickness check available. Let me see if I can show you the thickness check for the third pipe. It hasn't been received yet, so let's check the thickness check for the first pipe instead. It indicates that a thickness of 2.6 mm is required based on the inputs we provided, but the provided thickness is 2.66 mm, resulting in a utilization ratio above 1. That's why the entire pipeline is displayed in red.\n\nNow, let's switch to node displacements. Here, you can see the displacements for each node in the pipes, like this. That's how we can examine all these results.\n\nLastly, but importantly, let's discuss the isometric views. The application itself determines the most suitable view to define the isometric view of a particular pipeline. For example, for pipeline number 2, it suggests the southwest isometric view as the best option, providing visibility to all the lines. Similarly, for line number 3, it recommends the north isometric view. However, we can change it to the southeast view if desired. It's our individual choice. The application offers options to choose the paper size for generating the view, and scales are also available depending on", "doc_id": "6fad6062-d3f2-42fe-8b95-2005dd2312e1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "34a7f4b72a731b99b513da4d8d21c60bbe7433d7ad00b90d12cdc7f48f3223e0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 4100, "end": 8314, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4d81a287-56dd-4370-a10c-04c07d0e12ba", "2": "05cc778c-8c93-42c7-92ba-f0218aa379b3", "3": "bbf58eba-9442-487e-aeb8-c89289940aa6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbf58eba-9442-487e-aeb8-c89289940aa6": {"__data__": {"text": "to choose the paper size for generating the view, and scales are also available depending on our preferences.

It considers factors such as visibility, line coverage, and available space on the paper. You can choose the desired view from the suggested options or modify it according to your preference. The application also allows you to select the paper size and scale for generating the isometric views.\n\n\n\nCan we customize the symbols and text in the isometric views?\n\nYes, you can customize the symbols and text in the isometric views. The application is currently in the process of adding the required symbols and text to the isometric views for each line. This allows for further customization and clarity in the presentation of the piping model.\n\n\n\nDoes the application provide natural frequencies for the pipes?\n\nYes, the application calculates and provides the natural frequencies of the pipes within the analysis. This helps validate the mathematical correctness of the model. For each line in the piping model, you will receive the corresponding natural frequency.\n\n\n\nHow are changes in temperature and pressure applied to the pipeline?\n\nChanges in temperature and pressure can be applied to the pipeline by entering the relevant values in the pipe data. Once the initial values are entered for a specific line, subsequent pipelines will inherit those values automatically. Any changes made to intermediate pipelines will propagate to the lines below.

There, we also went through the details about the piping analysis application that IDS has. Now, we will just have a quick recap of that. Along with that, we may have some discussions on stress analysis of piping. Then, I will show you the transfer of forces from the piping application to the structural application. Now, I will be taking a file that I already ran so that we can see the revisions that we are maintaining, how the revisions are maintained, and how we are passing on that information to the structural group. So, we are logging in here. Okay, we will go into piping. Here, I will just open an existing model. It is the same model that we already discussed on Friday. So, okay, now a small change or update. I would say that we have added all the bands and everything into this model. This model could be called a complete model, including the reducers, bands, and everything you see here. Now, in this model, we already saw how we generate. Just a recap here. In the case of line modeling, we can add lines row by row and define the line number, pipe number. The pipe number will be automatically defined. We will enter the other parameters like central line elevation, preceding pipe number, start point coordinates, end point coordinates, or start point coordinates and length, and the change in direction of the line. Accordingly, the endpoint will be automatically calculated. Also, we saw that we can import or export this data in the form of CSV so that from any other application, like any other CAD model, we can import the information. Similarly, we can import/export from the SIM central library. Now, beyond line modeling, we will go to the design data. In pipe design data, here we define the actual cross-sectional library. We generally use the American one, and in that, we define the NPS value, we define the schedule, we define the material. Based on these three things, the OD and thickness will be automatically taken by the application. If we want to use any custom pipe, we need not give a cross-sectional library, NPS, or schedule. We have to directly enter the value of the material and outside diameter and thickness. Now, regarding corrosion allowances, here we have written it as zero, but the user can enter any value. You can enter it there, and that will be taken into account while performing the thickness checks. Also, in the stress checks, the mill tolerance is given by default as twelve point five percent, which is generally an adopted value in the industry. But the user always has the choice to make changes. For long-weld type, we have all four types listed here, and by default, it shows seamless weld. But one can choose the appropriate weld based on the pipe they are selecting and the material availability in the market. Now, with respect to that, we further add the restraints. So, for each pipe, we have to define the restraints. Once we go into the restraints, you can define them here. If you choose any of the first four values, your restraint does not need any editing. But if you choose, for example, the custom option, then you have to define the distance and whether it is a released support or if it has any spring value. Based on the entry made here, if you don't make any entry, it will be considered as a fixed support. If you make a released entry, it means the support is released in that particular direction. If you enter a numerical value, it will be taken as a spring value for that direction. That's how the support is defined. I will not make that change right now here.\n\nThe fluid density can be entered here. For example, for pp1, I will enter it as 1.120. Now, for the TNP (temperature and pressure) values, when we define any temperature and pressure values here, let's say the maximum design temperature is 200 degrees Celsius, maximum operating temperature is 150 degrees Celsius, minimum design temperature is room temperature (20 degrees Celsius), maximum ambient temperature is around 30 degrees Celsius, minimum ambient temperature is around 20 or 15 degrees Celsius. For internal design pressure, let's say it's 1.5 bar, and for the hydro test pressure, let's make it 1.5 as well. These are just random numbers for illustration purposes. Now, if we save", "doc_id": "6413314b-14e8-402d-a67d-fa39758ea69b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cca8b57407b5dd5155987962f571cf3e96042a4a6eec73b66ee4e3a651b2fc77", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4289, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2197c13a-413a-47c9-a68f-6d35688d6e06", "3": "e2bc97f3-8d1c-4987-82fe-c0e529c7b54a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2bc97f3-8d1c-4987-82fe-c0e529c7b54a": {"__data__": {"text": "as well. These are just random numbers for illustration purposes. Now, if we save this, you will notice that when I opened the TNP values here, it was empty. And if I open it for any other line, it will also be empty. However, for line 1, which starts from pp1 and ends at pp5, it will automatically have all the data we entered for pp1. So, if we go to pp4, it will have the same values as pp1, and if we want pp4 and pp5 to have different values, such as pressure drops, we can make a change in pp4 and the same change will be adopted by pp5. However, pp3 will remain unchanged. That's how we enter the TNP values.\n\nNext, let's move on to the end connectors. In the end connectors, we need to define the type of connectors based on the connectivity we have defined with the pipes. If there is a T-junction, for example, you will have a T option in the dropdown menu. The idea is to provide the correct default value, and if there are multiple choices, then you will get multiple dropdown options to select from. Within the dropdown, you can define the exact type of bend, such as miter bend, miter bend with a single piece in between, or a standard bend. Similarly, you have multiple options for T-connectors and other types of connectors. You can model straight pipes and supports in a similar way. You can also define flanges at the start and end of the pipe, specifying the class, material, and other details. This helps create an interface for the flanges. The model is designed to closely resemble reality so that engineers can provide accurate design parameters and sizes of components for the pipes. That covers the detailed modeling.\n\nNow, let's move on to loading. In loading, you can specify factors for dead load and add insulation loads to the pipes. For example, for pp1, if I want insulation of 10 mm with a density of 0.1 gram per mm cube, I can add that and give it a name, such as \"insulation 1.\" Giving a name here has several benefits. Firstly, you can import/export this data, so once you create a library, you can directly import it here. Secondly, the next time you make an entry, you will get predefined options based on the name you select. If you select a predefined option, the associated density will be automatically entered. This makes it convenient for future entries. You can also remove rows if needed.\n\nAdditionally, you can add other types of loads, such as point loads or uniformly distributed loads (UDL) over the length of the entire pipe or a partial length. The benefit of this type of loading is that if there's something in your piping system that cannot be modeled using the available components in IDS, you can still consider the load of that component on the pipe using this feature. You can choose the type of load, specify the distance from the start point, and enter the corresponding values.\n\nIn the seismic analysis, you can select the combination method and define other parameters. The seismic load is calculated based on the reciprocal of the natural frequency. By clicking on \"Generate Seismic Load,\" the seismic loads for each line at each node are generated, providing the output for analysis. The loads are calculated based on the dead load values already specified, which include the self-weight of the pipe, additional dead loads, and the liquid load inside the pipe, as it generates the maximum seismic load. Users have the option to modify the generated loads if desired.\n\nAfter the seismic load analysis, the next step is load combination. There are predefined load combinations, and you also have the option to define custom load combinations. If any changes are made to the predefined load combinations, the load values will be automatically updated. Users can select the desired load combinations to transfer the loads to the structure. This selection can be customized based on specific cases or requirements.\n\nIn terms of design codes, currently, the design is performed according to B31.3. However, other codes will be added sequentially. The discretization length limit refers to the length at which each pipe needs to be discretized and designed. For example, if you want the design to be performed for every 0.5-meter section of the pipe, you can define 0.5 here. The default value is", "doc_id": "e2bc97f3-8d1c-4987-82fe-c0e529c7b54a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d975d6ed5173e09fc42e24a5ceadf133a283acd825776c79da139eb76d68e642", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 4222, "end": 8478, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2197c13a-413a-47c9-a68f-6d35688d6e06", "2": "6413314b-14e8-402d-a67d-fa39758ea69b", "3": "c42d0d7c-6f4d-4e38-ad37-63d73938d60e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c42d0d7c-6f4d-4e38-ad37-63d73938d60e": {"__data__": {"text": "section of the pipe, you can define 0.5 here. The default value is usually set to 1 meter.\n\nReports can be generated for various aspects of the design. By selecting the design report option, the software will analyze the entire line set and perform the necessary design calculations. You can view reactions, membrane forces, member stress checks, pipe thickness checks, node displacement deflection checks, and MTOs (material take-offs) in the reports.\n\nFor example, the member stress check provides a color-coded visualization of the stress variation along the entire pipe for a given load. By selecting line 1, you can see the stress distribution based on the selected load.\n\nOnce you choose a specific load, the software provides information about the actual stress ratio and the allowable stress ratio for the pipe elements. For example, if the actual stress ratio is 0.089 and the allowable stress ratio is 1, it indicates that the line is not heavily stressed. Similarly, if you choose a different line, such as line 1002, and the actual stress ratio is 0.163 with an allowable stress ratio of 1, it suggests that the line is under relatively higher stress.\n\nIn the member stress check, you may notice gray color in between. This occurs because of the discretization limit set for the pipes and the splitting of curved members (such as bends) into multiple pieces. For bends, each piece is analyzed separately to evaluate the stress distribution. For example, if it's a miter bend, you will see results for each piece individually.\n\nThe member thickness check provides information about the required thickness and the provided thickness for the pipe elements. The thickness is color-coded based on the defined limits. For example, if you set the limit to 0.6, areas below 0.6 will be displayed in yellow-green, areas above 0.6 will be displayed in yellow, and areas beyond 1 (which exceeds the limit) will be displayed in red.\n\nYou can also check node displacements for each line, which provides information about the displacements at each node. This data can be exported to Excel for further analysis.\n\nMoving on to \"Loads to Structure,\" this step calculates the loads based on the load combination table and compares them with previously stored data. If there are changes, such as revisions in load reactions, the revision number will be incremented, and the status will be set to \"not issued.\" This allows the piping engineer to track and verify the changes in reactions. Once the loads are sent to the structure, the status is changed to \"issued.\"\n\nIn the structure module, you can load the model and visualize the pipe rack structure that supports the pipelines. Objects are displayed differently in the structure module, tailored for structural representation. Structural engineers can review clashes between their members and the pipes and can also attach the structure to the piping model.\n\nTo import the loads from the piping model into the structure model, you can use the \"Import Asset Slugs Piping Loads\" button. This action reads the load data and converts it into the appropriate units (e.g., kg). The loads can then be assigned to the structural members in the structure model.\n\nAfter assigning the loads to the members, structural engineers can proceed with their usual workflow, which involves adding members, defining supports, and analyzing the structural model. The integration between the piping and structure modules facilitates seamless collaboration and coordination between piping and structural engineers.\n\nIn the 3D modeling itself, pipes feed in the feed, you can see the support locations. Based on that, you can choose the exact coordinates where you want that particular member. To save time, I'm going to show you how to do that. The coordinates where you want that particular member. To save time, I'm going with the graphical connectivity, and now I'll go to the loadings. So, for pp1, the next second support, the pp1 second support is in line 1001. Here, I will choose the pipe rack one and attach it to the beam number, which is equal to b27. So, I'll just choose b27 here, and that's it. My loading is done. It is to b27. Now, at what distance?

My loading is done. It is to b27. Now, at what distance? For that distance, we need to have the location. Now, these things I'm doing manually, but as I already mentioned in the last meeting, my team is working on connecting these imported loads directly with the members intelligently, so that you don't need to define the distances. For this particular pipe, if you see under 3D modeling itself, go to the pipes and feed the support locations. Yes, there are two supports. One is at six meters, and it passes through the zero value, along the z-axis, and on the x-axis. So, my pipe rack is five meters wide, and if I want this line to be exactly at the center, I want it to be 2.5 meters from the start point of this beam. That's how I have to do it when I'm doing it manually. At 2.5 meters, the second support of line 1001, and that's it. This load, the entire row load, is assigned to that particular beam at the given distance. What my team is currently working on is selecting the beams appropriately and determining the distances based on the geometry. However, there are situations where supports are away from the beam, and the program will not find anything, so it needs to be defined manually. That's how we are currently managing it manually. But yes, we will provide additional utilities that will help users define specific distances and element numbers. The element number can be read from here, but the distance needs to be measured. That's our plan. So even after defining automatic assignments, if you have situations where there are no structural supports underneath them, you can add a new member at a specific location and assign those supports to that particular member. That can be done, and that's how we assign the imported loads to the members in the pipe rack. The attachment of the graphics can be removed if not required, but the loads will always be there once imported. So, if I go to the loading, pipe rack, and piping load direct load, you'll find all of them. That's how it works.\n\n\n\nHow can I import piping data into the application?\n\nYou can import piping data in CSV format or from the SIM central library. This allows you to import information from other applications or CAD models.\n\n\n\nCan I customize the pipe design data?\n\nYes, you can customize the design data by specifying the cross-sectional library, NPS value, schedule, and material. You can also enter custom pipe details directly, such as material, outside diameter, and thickness.\n\n\n\nHow are restraints defined for each pipe?\n\nRestraints can be defined for each pipe by selecting predefined options or choosing the custom option. If you choose the custom option, you can define the distance, whether it is a released support, or if it has a spring value.\n\n\n\nCan I specify fluid density and temperature/pressure values?\n\nYes, you can specify fluid density and temperature/pressure values for each pipe. The values can be entered, and they will be automatically considered in thickness checks and stress analysis.\n\n\n\nHow can I define connectors and bends in the piping model?\n\nIn the application, you can define different types of connectors based on the connectivity with the pipes. There are dropdown options to select the exact type of bend or connector, such as miter bend or T-connector.\n\n\n\nHow can I add loads to the pipes?\n\nYou can specify factors for dead load, add insulation loads, point loads, or uniformly distributed loads to the pipes. The application allows you to define various types of loads based on your requirements.\n\n\n\nCan I perform seismic analysis on the piping system?\n\nYes, you can perform seismic analysis by selecting the combination method and defining other parameters.

To answer this, I would like to raise some questions that we should consider. In today's digitally linked world, where many engineering and manufacturing plants use technologies like AI to automate their work and achieve better quality and productivity in less time, why are our plant engineers still struggling to generate inputs for computer programs that are already generated by other applications? For example, to model a system, one needs to enter each line point by point. Why can't it be automated? Why can't we link information from applications like CAD to generate the geometry? In most cases, your plant layout was prepared in parallel, and then the geometry for those pipelines is chosen from the CAD model for analysis in critical lines.\n\nThe next question would be: Why should we keep hunting for the correct data from the process data sheets for each line chosen for stress analysis? Why can't it be directly taken from the data sheets by the application itself? Why should stress analysis be limited to critical lines only? Only because we can.\n\nIf we can analyze the lines faster, in reality, we can analyze all the lines together. That will give us better confidence in our designs and better efficiency. Why should one use multiple applications for overall analysis as a beam model and then for local analysis as a model? Why can't we do all of that in a single application? Why should one not have to feed data like sieve factors, which are actually the core-related data? If you choose the right code for analysis, the factors given in the code should be automatically chosen by the application. Why should one enter this data?\n\nNow, the answer to all these questions is IDS. One can generate the geometry very smartly by linking it with data from other applications like SIM Central or your CAD application if you have the coordinates of the pipes and the pipe diameter data. Similarly, you can automatically link the correct data from CSV files into this application. You can literally analyze the entire piping system because the system gives you more time to work on it. It doesn't consume your time by manually entering the data; data entry happens automatically. Your engineers can focus more on engineering rather than feeding data into the applications. Similarly, IDS allows you to analyze your piping model as a beam model, and wherever you need local stress analysis, the same application is capable of providing you with the analysis of that specific area. The factors in the code, such as the safety factors that we generally enter in applications like Caesar, are automated in Ideas.\n\nThe most important thing is that IDS is a cloud-based technology that allows your engineers to access the application from anywhere in the world, provided they have the data related to that model. We do not store your data, but we are capable of processing your data from anywhere in the world whenever you request it. Engineers have worked for many years on line and models based on very rough sketches in the applications. Why don't they also see realistic models so that they can get a better feel for their designs? IDS provides you with all these facilities. That's why one would choose Ideas over other options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does IDS automate the process of generating inputs for computer programs and linking information from CAD applications?\n\nIDS streamlines the input generation process by allowing the automatic transfer of data from CAD applications, such as SIM Central, based on the coordinates and diameter information of the pipes. This eliminates the need for manual data entry, saving time and reducing errors.\n\n\n\nCan IDS directly extract data from process data sheets for stress analysis? Does it support non-critical lines as well?\n\nYes, IDS can directly retrieve data from process data sheets, eliminating the need for manual data hunting. It also allows stress analysis for both critical and non-critical lines, providing a comprehensive analysis of the entire piping system.\n\n\n\nHow does IDS handle multiple applications for analysis and data entry?\n\nIDS offers a single application that combines both overall analysis as a beam model and local analysis. It eliminates the need to use multiple applications, providing a more efficient and streamlined workflow.

Additionally, IDS automates the entry of core-related data, such as sieve factors, based on the chosen analysis code.\n\n\n\nCan IDS be accessed remotely, and how does it handle data privacy?\n\nYes, IDS is a cloud-based technology, allowing engineers to access the application from anywhere in the world as long as they have the relevant data for their models. IDS prioritizes data privacy by not storing user data.

While entering the huge set of basic guidelines for the layout generation, let us see what factors have an impact on the overall layout of a plant.\n\nThe first and foremost important factor is the type of project at hand. If it's a fresh project, the layout can be more freely decided. However, if it's an expansion project, it brings with it a lot of limitations, such as existing underground services. We need to take care of fixed time points for new and existing plants, limited access ways to the expansion site, and ensuring that the existing plant's functioning is not disturbed unless the new one is ready to be integrated. In cases where a small shutdown is taken to add the new plant to the existing process, the expansion projects may need to use some of the existing facilities, which adds an additional and sometimes tedious task of evaluating and integrating the new system by the engineering team.\n\nNext, the product type, its quality, and whether it is hazardous or non-hazardous, determine the safety parameters to be considered for each unit and the overall layout. Based on the client's needs, the current work may need to consider the possibility of future expansion, strategically locating units in the plant to accommodate future expansion. The space location for the operation of the plant requires specific requirements for equipment and piping based on the technology being used for the plant design. These requirements govern the decisions related to the accessibility, type, and product spaces.\n\nControl mechanism is another important factor that determines the equipment to be used for the entire plant, which in turn decides the needed structural arrangements and piping layout for the entire plan. A lot of services such as compressed air, water, nitrogen, etc., are needed for the plant operation. Piping and other supporting and controlling arrangements need to be properly balanced in designing the layout of these facilities, reaching out to the entire plant in an economical way.\n\nDepending on the type of equipment proposed, the schedule of plant construction, local environmental conditions, and coding guidelines, a specific material is chosen for each structure construction. This choice has an impact on the overall layout, including the cost and schedule of the project.\n\nOver the years, we have learned from past experiences and evolved with several health and safety guidelines to be followed to save lives and materials at stake. These guidelines need to be strictly observed during the layout definition, engineering, construction, and operation and maintenance of the plant. Waste generated in the plant can be in the form of effluence, solid waste, or a combination of both, and the volume, type, and frequency of waste generation require a waste management system that impacts the plant layout.\n\nDifferent regions in a country have different space utilization ratio limits, and sometimes clients have specific requirements to follow a minimum space utilization ratio, which is the ratio of available space to required space for the plant. This ratio needs to be maintained close to the expected value. The EPC industry, with its large production capacities, requires a significant investment to build and operate. Repairing faulty equipment can cause significant losses to processing units, so auxiliary or standby systems are incorporated to make the plant closer to fail-safe. These systems do not take part in the daily process but occupy space equivalent to the original equipment. They only run in emergencies when the existing equipment fails to operate or produce the required output.\n\nLastly, the plant needs access roads or railways for the transportation of personnel and materials. These networks need to be well-established to ensure smooth plant operations without hindrance or disturbance.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the reference standard used for developing the mentioned plant design?\n\nThe reference standard used for developing the mentioned plant design is \u201cIS 8091\u201d from the Bureau of Indian Standards.\n\n\n\nWhat factors impact the overall layout of a plant?\n\nFactors such as the type of project, whether it is a fresh project or an expansion project, existing underground services, fixed time points, limited access ways, and the need to maintain the functioning of the existing plant all have an impact", "doc_id": "c799e79d-a42b-46f7-9291-747d7ffc0469", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "784a6a6b1ba7c296c329226d559caaa8c131347b64839b6fec962c53c2015fb8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4556, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2c9a71c4-cc18-40e1-976b-d8337ff19da0", "3": "18deadbf-be25-4a51-b8da-8bf176b4f90d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "18deadbf-be25-4a51-b8da-8bf176b4f90d": {"__data__": {"text": "access ways, and the need to maintain the functioning of the existing plant all have an impact on the overall layout of a plant.\n\n\n\nWhat considerations should be taken into account when developing the plant design for expansion projects?\n\nExpansion projects come with limitations such as existing underground services, fixed time points, limited access ways, and the need to maintain the functioning of the existing plant.

Then we have node twenty here. If I delete the band, the band node is here, not there. But once I introduce the band here, this node is shifted to the end of the band. Let's go into the details. Node twenty has been shifted from here to here. Angle two is equal to zero, which means at the beginning of this bend, and it has created node eighteen. Angle one means the middle angle.

The dimensions depend on the thickness schedules of the elbow, diameter, and are detailed in the ASME code B16.25, which provides guidelines on how to prepare the edges for welding.

So, what is a bend? A bend is defined as a deviation in the direction of a pipeline. Suppose we need to transport fluid from a starting point here to an endpoint at this location. We arrange the pipe path by inserting the bend. The use of bends is an economical solution to avoid expensive pipe fittings. Additionally, the bends can be manufactured on-site according to specific needs using a bending machine for hot or cold bending, among other methods. Now, let's introduce the definition of an elbow as well. An elbow is a standardized engineered bend that is prefabricated as a spool piece following the A.S and B16.9 code. It can be connected using screw flanges or welding, and it is available in angular deviations of 35 degrees and 90 degrees. Curvature reducers can also be short or long. Remember, the choice of elbows is a compromise between space and hydraulic performance. In simple terms, larger cross-sections, diameters, and curvature radii result in lower pressure drop for the fluid. This helps reduce turbulence, and the fluid flow should be as smooth as possible.\n\nHowever, there are constraints in terms of space and cost, which prevent the use of excessively large bends or curvatures. In this slide, we can see the main classification of elbows. Piping elbows can be classified based on the direction angle. In this picture, you see a 45-degree elbow, and in this picture, you see a 90-degree elbow. There's also a 180-degree bend, which is very useful for achieving a specific bending path to mitigate thermal expansions. Elbows can also be classified based on the bend curvature. This refers to the radius of the bending, ranging from long radius to short radius. Please note that I'm referring to bend curvature radius with respect to the cross-sectional diameter. In this picture, you see the long radius elbow and the short radius elbow. The last classification is based on the type of connection to pipes. They can be either butt-welded piping elbows, which are bodies with holes to accommodate and weld the pipes, or socket-welded piping elbows, as shown in the picture. They are connected through welding at their terminal ends, featuring a chamfer and a welding bath. There are also threaded piping elbows, which are connected using a threaded coupling. Lastly, there are flanged elbows that are connected to the pipes using flanges and screws, without any additional welding.\n\nOne particular type of bend that deserves our attention is the metal bend. When standard fittings are missing, uneconomical, or not available, especially for larger pipe sizes, metal bends offer a solution. They allow for customized configurations by cutting and welding straight pipes together spontaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of using bends in a pipeline?\n\nBends are used in pipelines to deviate the direction of the pipeline, allowing for changes in the flow path and avoiding the need for costly pipe fittings.\n\n\n\nHow are bends different from elbows?\n\nBends and elbows are similar in that they both involve deviations in pipeline direction.

Bends or elbows are typically modeled as curved beam elements. The stiffness of these elements is determined using the Castigliano theorem, which involves integrating the potential elastic energy along the curved shape. This element assumes a linear elastic behavior and assumes a constant cross-section along the shape. These bend elements are assembled together with the straight pipes for the finite element analysis.\n\nDuring the analysis, we can obtain the resulting nodal forces at the terminal junctions of each pipe, as shown in the picture. However, it's important to note that the simple classical Euler beam theory, which works well for straight pipes, is not suitable for curved pipes due to their complex geometry. Additionally, non-linear effects can come into play, such as the amplification of bending stress. These phenomena, along with the deviation from linear behavior, are not considered in the analysis.\n\nIn the industrial context, where kilometers of pipelines need to be analyzed, performing a complete nonlinear analysis for every aspect is impractical. Therefore, the piping code B31.3 suggests performing a pure linear analysis using the finite element method and then correcting the resulting stress with an accurate stress intensity factor. The code provides flexibility factors and stress intensity factors for each type of band, including classical bands and meter bands.\n\nWhen checking the stress, we need to verify that the equivalent stress does not exceed the allowable stress. This is done using a formula similar to the von Mises approach, which considers axial, bending, and torsional stresses for straight pipes.\n\n\nFor vents, you can use the second formula to evaluate the bending stress, but you need to introduce a stress intensity factor for the in-plane and out-of-plane moment components. The in-plane stress intensity factor and out-of-plane stress intensity factor are important in this case. In the next slide, let's discuss flexibility factors. Linear static analysis cannot capture novelization, as mentioned earlier. The stiffness decreases nonlinearly as the deformation increases. Novelization occurs because the extreme outer fiber relaxes while the inner fibers work and support more load, bearing more stress. As a result, the cross-section's complete participation is not achieved, and the effective moment of inertia of the cross-section is reduced. According to the code's suggestion, the moment of inertia of the undeformed cross-section, before ovalization, is reduced by the flexibility factor. So, you take the original inertia and divide it by the flexibility factor found in the table. Fortunately, only bands require the bending factor flexibility. For other components like straight pipes or T-junctions, it is equal to one. Straight pipes usually don't experience ovalization as long as the stresses are well below the yield strength.\n\nFurthermore, for meter bands, which are the elements that can be approximated as a single curved element, without the need for splitting, we can easily adopt a linear curved beam model and then insert the appropriate stress intensity factor and flexibility factor.\n\nNow, let's move on to the discussion of the pressure effect. For curved pipes, hydraulic pressure exerts both hoop stress and longitudinal stress. Different formulas, based on various assumptions, are provided by codes to extrapolate these stresses. However, the most commonly used formula, as depicted in the slide, is the one used in Caesar II. Starting from the longitudinal stress and hoop stress, you can evaluate the hoop strain and longitudinal strain. The longitudinal strain is responsible for the linear expansion of the pipe. When checking the stress, remember to verify that the hoop stress is lower than the allowable stress, and the longitudinal stress should be added to the axial stress.\n\nNow, let's talk about elbow bends. Bends experience two different types of pressure expansion: translational pressure expansion, which is linear expansion like in straight pipes, and opening rotational pressure expansion known as the Bowden effect opening. In the case of classical bends, the pressure tends to open the bends.

The trend is reversed when the weld joints start yielding. That's why most codes suggest neglecting this effect, and the stress intensity factor value should cover this effect adequately. You can choose to activate only translational pressure expansion or both translational and rotational. However, I suggest always activating translational pressure expansion as it is usually sufficient. Keep in mind that if the pressure opposes novelization, making the elbow more rigid, the stress intensity factor and flexibility factor from the table must be corrected using correction factors. There is a correction factor for flexibility and another one for stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are bends or elbows modeled in the finite element analysis for stress analysis?\n\nBends or elbows are typically modeled as curved beam elements. The stiffness of these elements is determined using the Castigliano theorem, which involves integrating the potential elastic energy along the curved shape.\n\n\n\nWhat assumptions are made in the analysis of curved pipes?\n\nThe analysis assumes a linear elastic behavior and considers a constant cross-section along the shape. However, the simple classical Euler beam theory used for straight pipes is not suitable for curved pipes due to their complex geometry. Non-linear effects and bending stress amplification are not considered in the analysis.\n\n\n\nWhy is a complete nonlinear analysis impractical in the industrial context?\n\nPerforming a complete nonlinear analysis for every aspect of the pipelines, especially when dealing with kilometers of lines, is impractical. Instead, the piping code suggests a pure linear analysis using the finite element method. The resulting stress is then corrected using an accurate stress intensity factor.\n\n\n\nWhat are flexibility factors and stress intensity factors?\n\nFlexibility factors and stress intensity factors are provided by the code for each type of band, including classical bands and meter bands. Flexibility factors account for the reduction in the effective moment of inertia due to novelization, while stress intensity factors correct the resulting stress.\n\n\n\nHow are the stresses evaluated for vents?\n\nFor vents, the bending stress can be evaluated using a formula that incorporates a stress intensity factor for the in-plane and out-of-plane moment components.\n\n\n\nWhy are flexibility factors important in the analysis?\n\nFlexibility factors are crucial because they account for the reduction in the effective moment of inertia caused by novelization. The stiffness decreases nonlinearly with increasing deformation, and the participation of the cross-section is not complete.\n\n\n\nHow does hydraulic pressure affect curved pipes?\n\nHydraulic pressure exerts both hoop stress and longitudinal stress on curved pipes.

The allowable movement list in the catalog does not involve concurrent movement, meaning that only one movement exists at a time. Specifically, torsional displacement is assumed to occur separately, not concurrently. However, for concurrent movement, they are evaluated with a usage factor, which is a summation of each single effect according to this formula. The user's usage factor should be less than one, where X, Y, and theta represent concurrent axial, lateral, and rotational movements, respectively. Meanwhile, the terms XA, YA, and theta A are known concurrent allowable movements listed in the catalog for axial, lateral, and rotational actions, respectively. So, if I apply ten millimeters of lateral displacement and then two degrees of rotation separately, not at the same time, it is a worse situation if these displacements are applied together simultaneously. It's not the same situation because the single effects add up. Therefore, remember that the allowable movements are based on the reference fatigue life. But if I expect a different fatigue life or a maximum number of cycles for the entire component life, assuming I apply different displacements, the allowable movement can be adjusted according to the procedures described in the next slide. Let's see it together.\n\nOne method is to assign a dominant opening mode as the base mode, with its operating movement as the base movement. The movements of all operating modes are considered the same as the base movement, with the equivalent additional operating cycles calculated using the following formula, which is shown here. Where N is the number of operating modes, and I is the number of operating cycles for Mode I, and I is the ratio of the deformation mode I to that of the base mode. The other approach is a more simplified method. The movements of each operating mode are converted and normalized to correspond to the reference fatigue life. For example, the catalog provides a graph similar to the one shown in this slide, which is published in a catalog for reconstructive microstructural analysis. The normalized movements for all the postulated operating modes are then obtained, and these normalized movements are substituted into the previous equation to calculate the user's fatigue usage factor. The usage factor is limited to being equal or less than one.\n\nSuppose the benchmark fatigue life declared in the catalog is 3000 cycles, but we aim for a fatigue life of 7000 cycles. The correction factor here should be 3 or 1.2. This means that we have to divide the allowable displacement by 1.2, and then we can apply this usage factor formula. Regarding torsion, it's important to remember that it is not expected to occur in bellows. Most of the time, it is neglected in pipe analysis and considered to have a very high magnitude compared to other stiffnesses. However, practically, a residual torsional stiffness exists. So, the code provides criteria for torsional movement based on the stress generated at the cylindrical tangent portion of the bellows. The shear stress should not exceed 0.25 times the allowable stress of the bellows material. Where SS is the shear stress at the cylindrical tangent portion of the bellows, D is the outside diameter of the cylinder tangent, t is the wall thickness of the bellows, and SH is the code's basic allowable stress at the design temperature. The computed values of D and t are generally not given in the catalog, so they need to be obtained from the manufacturer if required. The value of D can be taken as the outside diameter of the connecting piping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of the Castigliano theorem in the finite element modeling of bends?\n\nThe Castigliano theorem is used to determine the stiffness of curved beam elements in the finite element modeling of bends.

Flexibility factors account for the reduction in the effective moment of inertia of the cross-section due to novelization, while stress intensity factors consider the effects of pressure and bending on the stress distribution in the bend.\n\n\n\nHow is the stress analysis of bends different from straight pipes in terms of pressure effects?\n\nPressure effects on curved pipes include both hoop stress and longitudinal stress. The formulas provided in codes allow for the extrapolation of these stresses, with the requirement that the hoop stress should not exceed the allowable stress and the longitudinal stress should be added to the axial stress for stress checking.\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the Bowden effect in elbow bends?\n\nThe Bowden effect refers to the opening rotational pressure expansion that occurs in classical bends. However, this effect is not the same for all bends, especially meter bands, where the pressure can cause a closing action. Most codes suggest neglecting this effect and rely on the stress intensity factor values to adequately cover it.\n\n\n\nHow are concurrent and non-concurrent movements classified, and how do they affect the analysis?\n\nMovements are classified into three categories: axial, lateral, and rotational.

The user's usage factor should be less than one to ensure the system's integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you clarify the methods for adjusting the allowable movement based on different fatigue life expectations?\n\nTo adjust the allowable movement based on different fatigue life expectations, two methods are described.

The other method converts and normalizes the movements of each operating mode to correspond to the reference fatigue life.\n\n\n\nWhy is torsion often neglected in pipe analysis, and what criteria are used when considering torsional movement in bellows?\n\nTorsion is often neglected in pipe analysis due to its relatively high magnitude compared to other stiffnesses.

Cold Spring is a process of offsetting the pipe system by imposing a displacement to reduce the absolute expansion load of the system.\n\nSo, let's start with the initial issue.\n\nSuppose we have an ambient temperature at the initial stage, where the reaction force is very low. However, as the temperature increases, thermal expansion will result in a higher reaction force.\n\nNow, let's discuss the offseason.\n\nAssuming this trend is almost linear, with the application of Cold Spring to the system, a form of artificial permanent deformation is introduced. This deformation opposes the thermal expansion. By shifting the material offset in this manner, the reaction forces at cold temperatures are reduced by 50%, allowing for the design of more economical hangers and supports. Similarly, the expansion below the bellows is also reduced by 50% or more, resulting in the expected movement.\n\nTo accommodate this Cold Spring effect, shipping bars are used. Therefore, Cold Spring must be incorporated into the piping, similar to the outer layer. Cold Spring has the following effects: force reduction of 50%, stability improvement of 50%, and a reduction in the potential movement by dividing it into two halves. Component clearance is also adjusted, reducing it by 50%.\n\nIn this section, I will show the main constructive features of a bellows assembly. A bellows is a component equipped with interface flanges to connect to the pipes. Some bellows have tie rods and limit rods. Tie rods are bars attached to the expansion joint to continuously retain the bellows pressure thrust while allowing only lateral deflection. Nuts are tightened in a way that eliminates any visible gaps. On the other hand, limit rods are used to restrict axial expansion or compression. They come into play in case of anchor failure, blocking the expansion or compression of the bellows. In the illustration, you can see that no gap is allowed due to the presence of limit rods. Movement is only permitted within a certain range. For angular rotation, two dice rolls located at 90 degrees opposite to the direction of rotation are used.\n\nThere are different types of expansion joints that can be connected using flange handlings, including special flanges. Vast stone hands have modified flanges and an additional intermediate elastic element to alleviate problems. Welded hands are directly welded to the pipe. A cover for the bellows can be provided to protect the delicate membrane from internal and external exposure.\n\nLet's delve into the main deformation of bellows, starting with the axial ones. In idle conditions, a bellows is actually flexible, requiring only a small force to cause significant axial deformation. However, problems arise when the bellows is pressurized, resulting in a larger pressure thrust force at both ends of the pipe, making anchoring and guides necessary at strategic locations. In this slide, I present a generic design strategy suggested in the code if the bellows is free to move without restrictions. Typically, we position a main anchor closer to one end, designed to support the axial load as given in this formula. The total axial force comprises the pressure thrust force (Pp), friction loads from the supports and guides (Ff), fluid flow momentum force, bellows resistance force, and the axial stiffness of the bellows represented by Kx multiplied by X. Pressure thrust forces should be isolated within two hangers and not absorbed by the equipment or machinery. Lateral guides are employed to prevent buckling and maintain stability. The first guide is typically placed at a distance of four times the pipe diameter, while the second guide is positioned at 14 times the pipe diameter. The maximum distance between the general guides is determined by the code. After the two guides, there is a maximum distance where additional guides can be placed. Several typical arrangements of the bellows expansion joint are proposed for absorbing axial forces. Case A represents a typical single-valve arrangement. Case B illustrates the typical arrangement of a long straight run when the bellows' capacity and support movement are limited.

In such cases, a double bellows can be used with a main anchor placed between them. In Case C, a T-junction can be provided at the main hanger, with another line connected as a branch using another bellows. Regarding the intermediate hanger in the second configuration, I want to emphasize that the anchor should be designed to support a specific axial force, which needs to be estimated. \n\nWhen the bellows are identical and generate the same pressure forces, theoretically the axial force is zero. However, for safety reasons, the designer should consider 10% or 20% of the full pressure force, depending on the design specifications. An uncertainty factor, denoted as C, is used to account for uncertainties arising from piping misalignment and bellows rotation. The differential bellows force is represented by the variable K.\n\nThen you have this uncertainty factor here, and this is for Case 2, where the axial force is different. In this case, we have a diameter variation with a reducer and a smaller bellows. So only the force PR2 is balanced. Thus, we need to use this other formula. In this case, which is the third one, we have a valve. If the valve is closed, all the pressure, I mean, the pressure thrust, is absorbed by this anchor and not balanced by this bellows. So, in this case, we have a total axial force which is equal to the differential bellows force plus the thrust force. In this case, we don't need the uncertainty factor.\n\nNow, before we move on, let's talk about the guides. The guides are special components that must be installed at the ends, considering the pipe alignment. Guides help control the motion of the pipe and the expansion joints. It should be noted that the alignment guides offered in the manufacturer's catalog are not capable of bearing the weight load, so they must be assembled with a fixed support that is designed to withstand the dead weight.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Cold Spring in the context of an expansion joint?\n\nCold Spring refers to a process used in piping systems to offset the pipe system by imposing a displacement. Its purpose is to reduce the absolute expansion load of the system by introducing a form of artificial permanent deformation.\n\n\n\nHow does Cold Spring affect the reaction forces in a piping system?\n\nWith the application of Cold Spring, the reaction forces at cold temperatures are reduced by 50%. This reduction allows for the design of more economical hangers and supports. Additionally, the expansion below the bellows is also reduced by 50% or more, resulting in the expected movement.\n\n\n\nWhat are the effects of incorporating Cold Spring into the piping system?\n\nIncorporating Cold Spring into the piping system has several effects.

Due to the interconnection of the pipe, the pipe at each end of the joint receives zero pressure thrust force because it is balanced. The spring rate of the overall joint is the sum of the individual spring rates of the three free individual bellows.

Now, let's examine the details of lateral movement and angular rotation, as they are interconnected. Let's explore the types of bellows that allow such movement.\n\nThe first type is a single-tied expansion joint, where the tie rods are tightened to prevent axial thrust at the expense of losing axial flexibility. Only lateral displacement is allowed, and the length determines the extent of lateral movement. In this configuration, an anchor is required for the lateral expansion joint.\n\nThe second type is the universal expansion joint, an improved variant composed of a pull pipe between two bellows to allow larger displacement. It builds upon the basic principle of the first type, extending both rotation and lateral displacement. The stability depends on the total length of the two bellows.\n\nNow, let me present a fusion of a pressure balance and a universal joint. In this case, it can also accommodate a flow changing direction with the use of a bend. Axial deformation and lateral movement can be absorbed. This solution allows for a large magnitude of movement and simplifies the layout surrounding the pipes. It is particularly useful in low-pressure turbines with condensers, pumps, and other pressure-sensitive equipment due to automatic pressure thrust balancing.\n\nTake a look at this animation to see how it works. You can observe axial deformation, lateral displacement, and extension. Additionally, in situations where the main flow direction shouldn't change, there is another variant available. The pressure force is balanced by the main valve, which is larger than the others. Axial and lateral displacement is allowed. Another economical solution for accommodating lateral movement or angular rotation is the hinged joint, also known as the pipe hinge joint.\n\nThe pipe ends at the joint are allowed to rotate in the same plane as the joint's rotation. They are typically installed in pairs or triplets to absorb expansion and contraction mainly in one plane. The distance between the hinges determines the allowable movement, while the bellow spring rate and hinge pin friction can generate significant forces and stresses. A hinge is usually modeled as a rotational flexible joint with a specific spring rate. The friction associated with the hinge is challenging to model and is typically accounted for in the spring rate itself. Various hinge configurations are commonly used.\n\nAnother variant is the double joint or gimbal joint, which allows rotation around two perpendicular axes. This provides increased flexibility when two principal movements are not in the same plane. However, it's important to note that these joints cannot absorb axial movement. For axial movement, they need to be combined in series. To achieve vertical flexibility, one can add a hinge joint to the configuration.\n\nNow, let's discuss slip joints. Slip joints allow the contact surfaces of pipe joints to slide apart from each other, providing axial slip and rotational slip. They are often used in harsh environments such as underwater or underground. However, due to imperfect sealing of the sliding surfaces, leakage concerns arise. This limits the use of slip joints in the transportation of dangerous fluids like petrol, which requires tightness. Constant application of considerable forces is necessary to maintain the gasket and packing, resulting in large internal friction forces that resist slipping movement. In some cases, the internal friction force is so significant that the joint loses its flexibility and ability to flex. Anchoring is designed to accurately estimate the pressure thrust force by incorporating the friction force into the spring constant approximation. Torsional movement is typically allowed, and the ball joint is a sturdy component with high flexibility. Its spring rate is evaluated based on its break-off movement.

Design guidelines exist for introducing flexible hoses, including choosing a line with a curvature radius that does not exceed a certain limit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the advantages of using corner pressure balanced expansion joints?\n\nCorner pressure balanced expansion joints provide a solution for absorbing axial and lateral movement in situations where a change in direction is required. They offer pressure balance and allow for fluid transport while maintaining lateral movement and angular rotation.\n\n\n\nHow are lateral movement and angular rotation interconnected in these expansion joints?\n\nLateral movement and angular rotation are generally interconnected in corner pressure balanced expansion joints. The joints allow for lateral movement and rotation in tandem, providing flexibility in absorbing expansion and contraction forces.\n\n\n\nCan you explain the different types of bellows that allow for movement in these expansion joints?\n\nThere are different types of bellows used in these expansion joints. The first is the single-tied expansion joint, which allows only lateral displacement while preventing axial thrust.

The case in this picture represents a situation where the anchor is erroneously oriented and designed. Mathematically speaking, the pressure forces of these two bellows induce a resultant force that acts at an angle. Intuitively, the designer would place the anchor according to the direction of this force. However, this is an idealized case where both bellows are pressurized. If one of these bellows does not function correctly or if we close this valve, what happens to this resultant force? The resulting force will change direction. Yet, the support was designed to withstand the force in the inclined direction, not along this direction. That's why this hanger is likely to fail due to the pressure thrust in this parallel direction. Another problem is with tie rods and limit rods. I mean, they serve the same function. \n\nThe function of tie rods in an expansion joint is to continuously restrain full pressure thrust during normal operation while allowing only lateral deflection. On the other hand, limit rods are used to restrict axial expansion or compression to a certain extent. They allow for lateral displacement only up to a certain point, while also limiting axial movement. Limit rods are designed to absorb the pressure thrust of the expansion joint in case the anchor fails. Misjudging the purpose of tie rods and limit rods can result in piping failure or operational difficulties. The first configuration, F1, is fine because the tie rods continuously absorb the pressure force while allowing the other side to move freely without the need for an anchor. However, if the tie rod knots are turned away from their initial position, creating a gap, it can cause issues.\n\n\n\nWhat is the consequence of incorrectly designing the anchor for the bellows?\n\nIncorrectly designing the anchor for the bellows can lead to failure of the hanger. When the pressure forces acting on the bellows change direction, the anchor may not be able to support the force properly. This can result in excessive stress on the hanger, leading to potential failure.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of tie rods and limit rods in an expansion joint?\n\nTie rods and limit rods serve similar functions in an expansion joint. Tie rods are designed to restrain the full pressure thrust during normal operation while allowing lateral deflection. They help maintain the stability of the joint. On the other hand, limit rods are used to limit the axial expansion or compression of the joint within a certain range. They provide protection to the bellows in case the anchor fails.\n\n\n\nWhat can happen if the purpose of tie rods and limit rods is misunderstood or misjudged?\n\nMisunderstanding or misjudging the purpose of tie rods and limit rods can lead to piping failure or operational difficulties. If tie rods are not correctly implemented to restrain the pressure thrust, it can result in excessive stress on the joint and potential failure. Similarly, if the purpose of limit rods is not properly understood, it may lead to inadequate protection of the bellows, potentially causing damage or failure under certain conditions.\n\n\n\nCan you explain the difference between tie rods and limit rods in terms of their movement allowances?\n\nTie rods are designed to allow lateral deflection while restraining the pressure thrust. They provide flexibility in the lateral direction to accommodate thermal expansion or contraction. On the other hand, limit rods restrict the axial expansion or compression of the joint. They have a specific range of movement beyond which they prevent further expansion or compression.

Tie rods are used to resist the longitudinal pressure thrust force, thereby preventing the bellows from being overstretched by pressure during normal operation. Limit rods, on the other hand, are used to protect the bellows from overstretching in the event of hanger failure or pipe buckling. They serve slightly different functions, and the difference lies in the gap between the nuts and the flange. As you can see here, in the first case, there is no gap, while in the second case, there is a gap. The limit rods come into play only if there is a failure of the tie rods. Misunderstanding the purpose of tie rods and limit rods can lead to piping failure or operational difficulties.\n\nThe first configuration is considered acceptable because the pressure force is fully absorbed by the tie rods, allowing free displacement. However, if the nuts are turned away from the correct position to create a gap during idle operation, the gap will close immediately when the bellows are pressurized. This poses a risk of overstretching the bellows beyond their design limits. Therefore, it is important not to modify the position of the nuts and convert tie rods into limit rods. The manufacturer specifies their purpose, so it's essential to follow their instructions.\n\nMoving on to another limitation, the picture illustrates joints used in the top portion of a multi-machinery installation, typically involving large pipes operating at ambient temperature. One common issue is the loosening or inadequate tightening of tie rod nuts in some units, leading to difficulties. If the nuts are not checked for proper tightness after installation, the forces become unbalanced. Consequently, the unbalanced thrust can push the equipment out of alignment, causing vibrations, overheating, and other problems. Bolts should be tightened appropriately, without excessive force that may pull the equipment out of alignment. It is important to follow the instructions provided during installation and maintenance.\n\nAnother common mistake is the automatic placement of anchors near expansion joints. Anchors are crucial for the proper application of expansion joints, but they should only be used when necessary and in the appropriate locations. Placing anchors in proximity to expansion joints without considering the specific type of expansion joint can lead to issues\n\nRemember, it is important to understand the purpose and proper installation of tie rods, limit rods, and anchors to ensure the integrity and functionality of the piping system.\n\n\nNo matter what type of valve it is, an anchor is only required for the bellows. I mean, only if you have tie rods. However, it is important to distinguish between different cases. In this configuration, when the pipes expand and the rods come closer, if you place an anchor where the equipment is located, a gap is created. This means that the force is unfortunately absorbed by the hanger and the equipment. If the equipment is delicate, it can be damaged quickly, such as a pump or turbine. So, this configuration is incorrect. The correct configuration is to use a sliding support instead of a hanger. This allows the bellows to expand while the pressure force is absorbed by the tie rods. The equipment and piping layout are protected in this case, as only the tie rods are responsible for the force.\n\nNow let's move on to modeling. To define an expansion joint, you can select an element and enable the \"Expansion Joint\" option, which will convert it into an expansion joint. Then you input the axial stiffness, translational stiffness, or lateral stiffness. Next, you specify the bending stiffness or torsion and the effective internal diameter for measuring the pressure thrust force. By adjusting the stiffness values, you can model different types of flexibility and flexible joints. For example, if you only want a pure axial joint, you set the axial stiffness to a high value and assign very high numbers for translational, bending, torsion, etc. to limit their effect.

The element below can be defined with the following input parameters: Stevenson and effective diameter. Remember that the stiffness behavior of the bellows is derived from the code, so it does not follow the normal pipeline assumptions of the Timoshenko beam theory. In torsional stiffness, remember that it must be declared, and normally, if you don't care about it, you can assign a very high value. If you declare axial stiffness and diameter, and leave lateral stiffness and bending stiffness blank, then those two will be automatically calculated using these formulas. In other cases, if only bending stiffness is blank and the rest is declared, then the bending stiffness will be automatically calculated from this formula, starting from the lateral stiffness or translational stiffness, depending on which one is blank. If both are blank, then they will be evaluated automatically using this formula starting from the bending stiffness. Theoretically, remember that a bellows can be composed not only of the membrane but also of a system of flanges and rods.\n\nTo define the bellows automatically, you select the main characteristics from the constructor and catalogs, and then it will split the selected element into other elements, creating nodes and rigid beams that simulate the rods. In between the rods, it will also create a control node, which is anchored to the start of the bellows, and introduce constraints simulating the degrees of freedom. These degrees of freedom allow for the realistic behavior of the bellows. For example, if you only want to allow rotations or lateral displacement, you can adjust the boundary condition in a control node format to achieve the desired displacement. The yellow and green components represent the flanges, which are rigid portions of the system. They are created automatically with infinite stiffness to simulate their rigid nature compared to the pipe and bellows.

Additionally, the piping needs to be revised to ensure compatibility with the selected hanger type.", "doc_id": "e33b2167-f94c-4e14-b065-929e304cffaa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6e649ce3486b2772d98166cb42e9afdccd2e295bf81d4ae2dc7719d62cd728f7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3916, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "67d5f1b2-b915-47fc-b39a-cf34a87b3206"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ea9feeb-e47c-4ce3-904a-11f47fc1b8d9": {"__data__": {"text": "I will take you through the end-to-end process of layout generation, preliminary analysis, and estimate generation on a very small scale. We will be working together to create a small module for a molecular sieve dryer, which can be considered a tiny plant. In this example, we will not delve into the details of how the technology of a molecular sieve dryer works. Instead, we will look at it from the perspective of a designer and how they begin working on layout generation.\n\nWhat we see on the screen is one possible final configuration. However, despite having the same process parameters, this configuration can vary due to factors such as space availability, construction type (modular or on-site), equipment inlet-outlet positions based on equipment design, and the individual's discretion in positioning the equipment relative to each other. While process parameters provide some limitations for equipment positioning, they do not precisely specify where each equipment should be placed in relation to others. There is a lot of freedom involved, and based on an individual's understanding of the process, space availability, and other parameters mentioned, one can generate their own layout. This is why different people may come up with different layout generations.\n\nNow, let's start generating a similar layout using the IDS tool, which is a cloud-based platform for engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you explain the process of layout generation in more detail?\n\nThe process of layout generation involves designing the arrangement of equipment and components within a system or plant. It considers factors such as space availability, construction type, equipment design, and individual discretion. It provides a visual representation of how the equipment will be positioned relative to each other.\n\n\n\nWhat are some examples of process parameters that can influence equipment positioning?\n\nProcess parameters can include factors like flow rates, pressure requirements, temperature ranges, and specific equipment specifications. These parameters help determine the overall system design and layout but do not dictate the precise placement of individual equipment.\n\n\n\nHow does the IDS tool assist in layout generation?\n\nThe IDS (Integrated Design System) tool is a cloud-based platform for engineering that provides features and functionalities to facilitate the layout generation process. It offers tools for creating and manipulating equipment models, analyzing spatial constraints, and generating visual representations of the layout. It enables engineers to explore different layout options and make informed decisions based on various parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any limitations or constraints to consider when generating a layout?\n\nWhile there may be process-specific constraints or guidelines, the layout generation process also involves individual discretion and consideration of factors such as space availability, construction type, and equipment design. It allows for flexibility and customization based on the designer's understanding of the process and project requirements.\n\n\n\nCan different individuals using the IDS tool generate completely different layouts for the same project?\n\nYes, different individuals using the IDS tool can generate different layouts for the same project. This is because the layout generation process involves subjective decisions based on individual understanding, experience, and project-specific requirements. While there may be some common elements, the final layout can vary based on the designer's choices and preferences.\n\n\n\nHow does the preliminary analysis and estimate generation fit into the layout generation process?\n\nPreliminary analysis involves evaluating the feasibility and performance of the layout design, considering factors such as equipment placement, accessibility, and system requirements. Estimate generation involves assessing the cost and resource requirements for implementing the layout. These steps help refine the layout and ensure its viability before proceeding with detailed design and construction.", "doc_id": "1ea9feeb-e47c-4ce3-904a-11f47fc1b8d9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f3c66f45ab20b6740d06900d77e5605a3fb5009bd8acd6ee808cf0fb5ebeed0c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4073, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0c744bb6-7440-4740-83ee-0434e66b49b8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "21427c7b-65ef-4512-a0b8-a92fd79f26df": {"__data__": {"text": "Let us first try to understand what sort of inputs we receive. In this case, we have received three inputs: the molecular sieve dryer P&ID, the dryer equipment list, and the module's conceptual sketch. Let's understand each of them separately. First, the P&ID is a piping and instrumentation drawing that provides more details than a PFD (Process Flow Diagram). A PFD shows the major equipment connectivity, while a P&ID includes both major and minor details of the chemical process. It shows major equipment and piping details such as service, size, specification, rating, insulation, etc. Each line on the diagram has specification numbers indicating the type of material, construction, diameter, and thickness of the pipe. Process parameters are defined by tags and displayed on the table, such as design pressure and temperature.\n\nThe diagram also includes instrumentation details, such as pressure, temperature, and flow instruments, control valves, pressure safety valves, and pressure meters. It shows the actual pipeline routing conditions, such as free flow, slope, minimum distance, and tapping from top or bottom. The diagram provides a 2D representation of the entire system. As part of the module generation, we will convert this 2D P&ID diagram into a 3D representation called a 3DPFD, where the connectivity will be visible in a three-dimensional picture.\n\nWe also have a conceptual sketch provided by the client, which shows the expected arrangement of the module. In this case, the client suggests placing the big dryers in front of each other, with two filters next to them. The module can be further divided into two smaller modules, one measuring 5 meters by 10 meters and the other measuring 2.5 meters by 10 meters. The client expects the entire plant to fit within a 7.5-meter by 10-meter by 9-meter module. This sketch represents the client's preliminary expectations\n\nIn addition to these inputs, we have the dryer equipment list, which includes details of the molecular sieve dryer and the filters. The molecular sieve dryer has a diameter of 4.4 meters, a height of 9.3 meters, and weighs approximately 70 tons. There is another identical sieve dryer. The two filters have a diameter of 1.25 meters, a height of 5.5 meters, and weigh around 7.5 tons each. The client also mentions a third filter, although it is not shown in the sketch.\n\nBased on all this information and the process parameters from the P&ID diagrams, the client expects several deliverables, including the module layout, piping routing with isometrics, piping MTO (Material Take-Off), valve MTO, instrument list, structural bill of quantities, stress analysis, and support MTO. Most of these quantities can be determined during the analysis phase. The isometrics are part of the detailing process but can also be extracted at the analysis level. The instrument list and support MTO are typically developed after the complete detailing of the system.\n\nIn the next steps, we will start placing the equipment in the 3D space and establishing connectivity between them.

This designer tool is designed in such a way that any engineer with basic engineering knowledge can simply start using the available tools. You do not need specific training to use it. So, let's directly start creating a simple layout.\n\nTo generate the layout, we begin with the equipment layout. We have different equipment options available in the process tool palette, such as sources, sinks, valves, pipes, mixers, separators, heat exchangers, and air fin coolers. Placing them is like playing a simple game. You just drag and drop them wherever you want.\n\nFor example, let's start with a source. From the source, we generally need a control valve, so I'll place a valve there. From the valve, I will connect it to a tank by dragging and dropping a tank. Then, from the tank, I will connect it to a pump, which will push the fluid towards the next part of the process at the sink. Along the way, I may add another valve. This creates a small Process Flow Diagram (PFD) where fluid flows through a control valve, gets stored in the tank, and then is pumped to the next stage through another control valve.\n\nBut how do we ensure that the equipment is placed correctly? We can view them from different angles, such as from the top, back side, or other perspectives. When looking from a specific angle, we can adjust the equipment's position by holding the shift button and dragging it up or down.\n\nHowever, in engineering, we don't rely on approximate positions. Instead, we first place the equipment at the precise locations as indicated in the process flow diagrams. For example, if the tank's elevation is given as 2 meters, we can double click on the tank and set its elevation value as 2 meters, and the tank will be placed at that height. Similarly, we can adjust the precise locations of other equipment, or use the drag and relocate method I mentioned earlier.\n\nNow, let's talk about creating connectivity. When you double click on each equipment, you may have noticed a green connector being generated. This is the point from which the supply can flow to the next level.\n\nIf I double-click on the valve, you will find one blue connector and one green connector. The blue connector is the receptor, while the green connector is the transmitter or the starting point of the flow. The green connector indicates where the flow begins, while the blue connector represents the endpoint where the flow ends and continues to the next step. So, from the source, we have connectivity to the valve. When I double-click on the source, I see a green ball. By holding the control button and clicking on this green ball, it activates the receptor points of all the equipment. Now, when I double-click on the valve, I see a blue point and a green point. The green point is the starting point of the valve's connectivity, while the blue point represents the endpoint. When I use the control button to connect the green point of this equipment, it will show me all the blue points that are now in selection mode, indicated by their green color. While it may sound confusing when explained, it becomes familiar when you start using it. By holding the control button and clicking on a blue point, I can create a connection line between them. To turn the line into a pipe, I simply drag and drop a pipe onto the line and enter the desired diameter, schedule, and material grade.\n\nFor the connection between the valve and the tank, I double-click on the valve, control-click on the connector, and connect it to a point on the tank. The line will enter the tank and connect to the desired point. To define it as a pipe, I select the same specifications as before. If I want to adjust the direction of the line, I can use the axis directions (X, Y, Z) to determine the desired combination. For example, I want the line to follow the Z, X, Y combination. This means it first moves in the Z direction, then X, and finally Y.\n\nIf I want to always follow this specific path and regenerate the next pieces of the path, I can lock certain segments. Each segment,", "doc_id": "117bedbf-78fd-43f5-bc88-24f95e3d3f17", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4a43e3a632bd23aaad67f391fab499bb2a60a2665f8de41d1d173aefd4489e39", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4178, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "704b5a0c-e8b8-4fe4-b2cf-2b50b6c47a7c", "3": "d628985b-d0b8-453e-afa8-25cb4ada8be2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d628985b-d0b8-453e-afa8-25cb4ada8be2": {"__data__": {"text": "the next pieces of the path, I can lock certain segments. Each segment, from the start point to the end point of the line, is listed, and I can lock the direction of each segment. By locking a segment, it remains fixed regardless of any movement or changes made. This allows us to have a specific combination of line routing. If I remove the lock, the arrangement will be re-established.\n\nNow, let's focus on the tank's elevation. We wanted to have it at a 2-meter elevation, so we can adjust the position accordingly.\n\nWe have seen how to create line connectivity. I will now complete the line connectivity between the further equipment from here to here and from here to here. Lastly, from this point to this point. We need to add pipes to these connections, so let's add the pipes one by one. Yes, we can use 4-inch pipes, or alternatively, we can use a different size, such as 6 inches from this point onwards. I will use 6-inch pipes here, with a standard schedule and grade 106B. Similarly, we will use a 6-inch pipe for this connection as well. So, we have 6-inch pipes with a standard schedule and grade 106B. Lastly, we will use the same size, 6 inches, with a standard schedule and grade 106B for this connection.\n\nHowever, it is not very clear whether the pipeline routing is feasible based on these diagrams. It seems quite challenging. Let's see how it looks with realistic pipes. To do that, we will enable the display of pipes with a certain level of transparency. Yes, this is what is happening here. We have the valve, and from the valve, it turns like this and gets connected over here. That appears to be quite feasible. In this case, it seems to be more complicated. So, let me go to the side view and reposition the pump. This is one way I can do it. Another way to accomplish this is by aligning the Z point of the pump's connector. Now, this pump is just an indicative representation and may not be exactly to scale. So, I can adjust the connector point of the pump to align it with the actual equipment. When the relative position of these two points needs to be defined, I can relocate the pump's connector point in line with the line coming from the tank. To do that, I will first fix this point. I want this point to be precisely in line with the line coming from the tank. Now, I need to adjust the Z coordinate of this point. \n\nFor that, I will go into the pump. I will navigate to the end of the pump or the line ending on the pump that comes from the tank, and I want to match the Z direction or maybe the XZ plane with the global Z value so that it aligns exactly with this point here. So, I will align it with the XZ plane. Similarly, we can determine the relevant position of the pump's outlet with respect to the pump's drawing or consult the pump vendor to position the outlet as required. For example, if I want to align it again in terms of the XY plane of the valve, it should be placed over here. This way, we can rearrange the connector positions. Now, regardless of how we move this equipment, the pipeline will auto-route based on their positions and show us the feasibility of the pipeline. For example, if I place the sink connector here, it will not allow me to place the bends. So, either it should be exactly in line with this or placed somewhere else to accommodate all the required bends. The direction can also be changed. For example, I may rotate it 90 degrees here and then place it like this. This way, we can generate the overall process layout. In the next session, we will generate the actual layout of the molecular sieve dryer and begin building the pipelines and structures around it.\n\n\n\nCan you explain how to create line connectivity between equipment in more detail?\n\nTo create line connectivity between equipment, you need to double-click on the equipment to see the connectors.

First of all, we select the pipe and apply the wind shape factor. Typically, the wind shape factor is either 1, 0.7, or 0.77, depending on the code being followed. It's similar to the concept of the drag coefficient in fluid dynamics. After selecting the pipe element, we apply the wind load at specific positions, such as the mid-circuit of the pipe. The selected pipe element with the activated wind load will experience the wind load.\n\nLet's proceed with the analysis. First, we need to check the accuracy of the analysis. Then, we launch a preliminary run to ensure everything is correct. In the load case editor, we can manually define the load cases. If we access the option to edit the static load cases during the model creation, we can also add the wind load. Each wind load component needs to be created separately, taking into consideration the pressure applied along the pipe based on its height. The wind load depends on factors such as the code, terrain, velocity, and wind direction. It's advisable to consult the relevant code to determine the appropriate design for a specific region. The wind load direction can be defined along the x, y, and z axes.\n\nIf necessary, custom wind load profiles can be manually inserted. This allows us to define a specific pressure or wind velocity profile against the pipe, considering the drag coefficient. The forces will be automatically evaluated and applied as a distributed load in the scissor. However, using standard code profiles eliminates the need for manual work.\n\nOnce the wind load is defined, we can create load cases, such as the operating case that includes factors like dead weight, temperature, and pressure. Additionally, we can create load cases for each wind load direction. To isolate the effect of only the wind load, we can create an occasional load case by subtracting the load case without the wind load from the load case with the wind load. The choice between algebraic or scalar subtraction depends on the specific requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I determine the wind shape factor for my specific code?\n\nThe wind shape factor is typically specified in the code or standard you are following. It may vary depending on the code and region. Consult the relevant code or standard documentation to find the appropriate wind shape factor for your specific case.\n\n\n\nCan you explain the concept of the drag coefficient in fluid dynamics?\n\nThe drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that represents the resistance encountered by an object moving through a fluid. It depends on the shape of the object and the properties of the fluid. In the context of wind load, the drag coefficient is used to determine the pressure or force exerted by the wind on a structure such as a pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I select the positions to apply the wind load on the pipe?\n\nYou can choose specific positions along the pipe where you want to apply the wind load. These positions can be determined based on the design requirements and the structural behavior you want to analyze. It's common to apply the wind load at mid-circuit or other critical points where the wind forces are expected to have a significant impact.\n\n\n\nWhat factors should I consider when defining the wind load in the load cases?\n\nWhen defining the wind load, you need to consider several factors: the code or standard being followed, the terrain in which the structure is located, the wind velocity, and the wind direction. These factors will help determine the magnitude and direction of the wind load acting on the pipe.\n\n\n\nCan I use a custom wind load profile instead of the standard code profiles?\n\nYes, you have the option to define a custom wind load profile if you have specific requirements or if the standard code profiles do not adequately represent your scenario. By manually specifying the pressure or wind velocity profile against the pipe, taking into account the drag coefficient, you can accurately simulate the wind load. However, using the standard code profiles is often recommended to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.\n\n\n\nHow do I create an occasional load case to isolate the effect of the wind load?\n\nTo create an occasional load case that isolates the effect of the wind load, you can subtract the load case without the wind load from the load case with the wind load.

First of all, let's check the boundary conditions, credit conditions, and define temperature 1, temperature 2, hydrostatic pressure, and other restraints. To do this, we can go to the \"Edit Static Load Cases\" option. When you press this button, Caesar will automatically select the combination of all the load cases you need to use. Here is the list: hydrostatic test cases, operating cases including the weight of the fluid inside the pipe, temperature 1, and hydraulic pressure. We also have other load cases that are obtained through algebraic subtractions of the previous load cases. These are load cases automatically created to determine the stress caused by external expansion.\n\nNow, let me show you how to create another load case. If you want to add a new load case, you can insert a new row. For example, let's create a load case for sustained load, which represents a constant weight. Voila! We have created another load case. Alternatively, instead of assuming the pipe to be empty, you can choose to include the weight of the fluid inside. This is called the hydrostatic case. You can also create load cases that consider thermal expansion. Just copy and paste the definition, make the necessary modifications, and voila! Now, I will show you how to incorporate a uniform load distribution on the second pipe. You can add it to a specific load case. In this example, I included it in the load case that already considers weight, temperature 1, and pressure 1.\n\nRemember that when combining load cases through algebraic sums or subtractions, you need to choose the appropriate method, such as algebraic, scalar, S square root sum, absolute value, or max. The choice depends on the specific requirements and is often used for seismic loads. The \"Activate Anger\" option is available if you want to consider the stiffness of anger, but it's not relevant for this lesson.\n\nKeep in mind that the default elastic modulus is based on the cold temperature. However, if the operating temperature is different, like T1, you should select the corresponding elastic modulus. Additionally, the stiffness of elbows may vary based on the internal pressure, so remember to set up the parameters for elbow stiffening.\n\nOnce you have completed the load combination list, you can proceed with the analysis by clicking \"Analyze\" and answer the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I define temperature 1 and temperature 2 in the load cases?\n\nTo define temperature 1 and temperature 2 in the load cases, you can specify their values within the load case definition. These temperatures are used to account for thermal effects in the analysis.\n\n\n\nCan you explain the concept of a sustained load in more detail?\n\nA sustained load represents a constant weight that remains applied to the structure over an extended period. It is typically used to consider the long-term effects of a consistent load, such as the weight of a structure itself or permanent fixtures.\n\n\n\nHow do I incorporate a uniform load distribution into a specific load case?\n\nTo incorporate a uniform load distribution into a specific load case, you can add the load case details and specify the distribution parameters. This allows you to consider the additional load applied uniformly across the structure.\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between algebraic sum and algebraic subtraction when combining load cases?\n\nWhen combining load cases, the algebraic sum refers to adding the loads together, while algebraic subtraction involves subtracting one load case from another. These operations help determine the combined effect of different loads on the structure.\n\n\n\nHow do I choose the appropriate method for combining load cases, such as scalar or S square root sum?\n\nThe choice between scalar or S square root sum depends on the specific requirements and engineering considerations. Scalar sum adds the magnitudes of the loads, while S square root sum takes the square root of the sum of the squares of the loads. The appropriate method will vary based on the load combination scenario.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of the \"Activate Anger\" option in load cases?\n\nThe \"Activate Anger\" option is not relevant for this lesson, so we won't go into", "doc_id": "c2d97b31-122a-4c45-ae58-2a24a356d6fd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dd3b6295884ba229a41a30176b677bb36da136b1a958682adea8e466e1f64816", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4207, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7a96e17f-be94-4b38-b95d-caaef6a69bac", "3": "57fdd5fd-a627-4786-ab20-7ab114799086"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "57fdd5fd-a627-4786-ab20-7ab114799086": {"__data__": {"text": "Anger\" option is not relevant for this lesson, so we won't go into further details about it. It's best to focus on the relevant load cases and their combinations.\n\n\n\nHow do I set up parameters for elbow stiffening?\n\nTo set up parameters for elbow stiffening, you need to specify the appropriate values related to the stiffness of elbows in the load case definition. These parameters ensure that the analysis accurately represents the behavior of the elbows under different loading conditions.\n\n\n\nCan you explain the meaning of the elastic modulus and its connection to operating temperature?\n\nThe elastic modulus is a material property that measures its stiffness or ability to resist deformation. In the context of load cases, the elastic modulus at a given temperature determines the structural response to applied loads. It's important to select the correct elastic modulus based on the operating temperature to accurately capture the behavior of the structure.", "doc_id": "57fdd5fd-a627-4786-ab20-7ab114799086", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5b4ca26a2b39c16d0433d0257015c27cb44879122b1d7a3f70a5ac47af87859c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 4141, "end": 5105, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7a96e17f-be94-4b38-b95d-caaef6a69bac", "2": "c2d97b31-122a-4c45-ae58-2a24a356d6fd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e012fdc1-f15f-4ea0-aba3-136ce105bdd3": {"__data__": {"text": "The environment, specifically the special settings and execution parameters. Let's take a look. First, we have the option to print the forces on rigid and expansion joints. This is useful if you have implemented bellows or elastic joints, or if you want to analyze the forces acting on rigid bodies.\n\nNext, we have the burden effect. This refers to the mechanical impact of internal pressure on the pipe. You can choose \"None\" if you don't want the pressure to affect the pipe mechanically. Alternatively, you can activate linear translational expansion or translational plus rotation to account for the burden effect caused by the pressure. It's worth noting that the rotational effect is still a subject of debate.\n\nMoving on, we have the bowing parameter. This allows you to consider a different temperature distribution across the cross-section of the pipe. However, in most cases, this parameter is set to zero.\n\nThe allowable stress depends on the code you are using. You can analyze the stress and determine whether the criteria for pass or failure are met. The allowable stress can be evaluated in a conservative or liberal manner, depending on your needs. It's important to refer to the code for specific guidelines.\n\nThe ambient temperature corresponds to the reference temperature at which no thermal expansion occurs.\n\nBefore starting the analysis, it's crucial to check these main parameters. If you're not satisfied with the convention of the vertical direction, you can choose another option to align it with the gravity or another load direction.\n\nAdditionally, when defining the isometric view of a pipe, it's important to specify the north and east directions. By default, the north direction is set to x minus, but you have the flexibility to choose a different direction if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the burden effect and how does it affect the pipe?\n\nThe burden effect refers to the mechanical impact of internal pressure on the pipe. When the burden effect is activated, the pressure inside the pipe can cause linear translational expansion or translational plus rotational movement. This effect tends to open the bands of the pipe due to the pressure. However, the rotational effect is still a matter of debate and may not be fully understood.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of the bowing parameter in the analysis?\n\nThe bowing parameter allows for the consideration of a different temperature distribution across the cross-section of the pipe. It accounts for any potential bowing or deformation that may occur due to variations in temperature. However, in most cases, this parameter is set to zero, indicating a uniform temperature distribution.\n\n\n\nHow is the allowable stress determined in the analysis?\n\nThe allowable stress depends on the specific code being followed. The analysis evaluates the stress in the pipe and compares it to the criteria specified in the code. Based on this evaluation, it is determined whether the stress is within the allowable limits or if it exceeds the limits, indicating a failure. The choice between a conservative or liberal evaluation of the allowable stress depends on the requirements and guidelines provided by the code.\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the ambient temperature in the analysis?\n\nThe ambient temperature corresponds to the reference temperature at which no formal expansion is expected to occur in the pipe. It provides a baseline temperature for the analysis and is used as a reference point to calculate thermal expansion effects.\n\n\n\nCan I change the direction of the vertical axis in the analysis?\n\nYes, you have the flexibility to change the convention of the vertical direction in the analysis. By default, the vertical direction is aligned with the x-axis in the negative direction. However, if you prefer a different vertical orientation, you can select the appropriate option to align it with the gravity or another desired load direction.\n\n\n\nHow do I define the north and east directions in the isometric view of a pipe?\n\nWhen defining the isometric view of a pipe, you have the ability to specify the north and east directions. These directions help establish the reference frame for the pipe model.

You can apply warping, zoom in, and observe the significant deformation in specific areas. For example, here you can see a notable deformation. You can also adjust the perspective. Let's return to the previous view. Now, let's examine another load case. This is the animated representation. If you wish to visualize variations in stress, displacement, or reaction forces in a graphical format, you can utilize the option of 3D plotting. Let's explore this feature. Here's the pipe model. I've selected a specific load case. Now, you can employ any color scheme you prefer. \n\nThe specific colorization doesn't matter. Let's examine the deflected shape. You can now compare the initial shape with the deformed shape. Additionally, you'll observe a gradual movement. Personally, I find this feature useful. Each line is assigned a unique number for reference. Now, let's consider stress. Currently, I see that it's displayed in green, indicating level 3, corresponding to this value. What if we use a different color scale? Now, we observe yellow coloration, indicating a different stress level. This value represents the stress normalized at the first center with respect to the allowable stress. Consequently, it suggests a potential failure point in the pipe, as the reaction forces are excessively high. Therefore, if there's substantial deflection in this area, it's likely due to resistance momentum. It's advisable to add a support in this location.

If there are strong winds, seismic waves, or rotating equipment like pumps, it is crucial to operate the system at frequencies far away from these eigenfrequencies to avoid any potential issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to perform a frequency analysis or modal analysis for pipelines?\n\nPerforming a frequency analysis or modal analysis for pipelines is important to determine the natural frequencies of the pipes. By knowing the natural frequencies, we can identify potential resonance effects or vibration problems that may occur in the future. This information helps in designing and operating the pipeline system safely and avoiding any adverse effects caused by vibration or resonance.\n\n\n\nWhat are snubbers and how do they affect the analysis?\n\nSnubbers are components used to support and protect the pipe during occasional loads, such as seismic events or wind. They help to dampen vibrations and reduce the stress on the pipe. In the analysis, the presence or absence of snubbers affects the dynamic response of the system. If snubbers are present, their influence on the pipe's natural frequency and mode shapes needs to be considered. However, if snubbers are not present, their effects can be excluded from the analysis.\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between lamp masses and consistent mass matrix in the analysis?\n\nLamp masses and consistent mass matrix are two approaches for handling the mass distribution in the analysis. Lamp masses assumes that all the mass of each pipe element is concentrated at the nodes. This simplification allows for faster calculations but may sacrifice some accuracy. On the other hand, consistent mass matrix assumes a uniform mass distribution along the pipes, resulting in a more accurate analysis but with increased computational time. The choice between lamp masses and consistent mass matrix depends on the level of accuracy required for the specific analysis and the available computational resources.\n\n\n\nHow can the results of the modal analysis be used in practical applications?\n\nThe results of the modal analysis provide valuable information about the natural frequencies", "doc_id": "11f831e7-e980-4e09-92ad-539062a60518", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7a798f5cf90751fd41eec1a9828205c6a549676e33e8d41096531b003dd8b505", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4376, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "692f8fd9-54a5-45bd-b333-c1bb9d3b9026", "3": "dced041f-14a6-4e55-a1b4-94f0f014709b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "dced041f-14a6-4e55-a1b4-94f0f014709b": {"__data__": {"text": "results of the modal analysis provide valuable information about the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the pipeline system.

This is the pipe element that I have created. This is the coordinate frame, and remember that the vertical direction is the y-axis, while z and x represent the other directions. Normally, the negative x-axis represents the north direction. This is the pipe element, and of course, I can also change the size, whatever you prefer. I can also make it thicker. Then I can zoom in here and rotate if I get lost. Oh my god, I can't see my pipe element anymore. Where is my pipe? Then I can use the zoom feature to automatically zoom and get back to the entire system. Additionally, I can translate my point of view. I usually prefer using the orbit option, so by pressing the middle button of the mouse, I can translate and rotate as needed.\n\nYou can select the pipe and use this box to select all the pipes in a specific volume. Moreover, let me show you something I really like. Normally, I prefer using the 3D graphical representation of the pipe, but if you don't like it, you can switch to the wireframe view or activate transparency to make the pipe slightly transparent. In case you don't prefer the 3D representation, you can also activate this option and view the pipe as a symbol line. If you want to see the nodes and their labels, you can activate that option as well. You'll see the node numbers and labels. With this button, which I really like, you can see the length of this element.\n\nAnother feature I really appreciate is this one. Let me pause and change the direction. Okay, this is the orthogonal visualization, but if I activate this option, I can see the perspective view. If you don't like the colors, you can change the legend as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I change the size of the pipe element in the 3D environment?\n\nTo change the size of the pipe element, you can select it and adjust its dimensions using the provided tools or options in the software. This will allow you to customize the size according to your requirements.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to reset the view if I get lost or can't find my pipe element?\n\nYes, you can easily reset the view by using the automatic zoom feature. It will bring you back to the default view, allowing you to locate your pipe element again.\n\n\n\nCan I change the representation of the pipe from 3D to something else?\n\nYes, you have the flexibility to change the representation of the pipe.

Why is it useful? I will demonstrate using this example. As you may recall, I have this table that can be modified. I can extend and modify all the pipes as needed. I can copy and paste this table, delete and revert it. I can also copy and paste it into Excel. For instance, I can use Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste this table. Let's suppose you receive an Excel file with a complete table containing all the definitions of each piping element. If you want to add or modify values in this updated table, unfortunately, you cannot directly copy and paste it here. It requires a manual operation. However, there is another solution: the Neutral file. Let's explore it. I want to save it, and now let's access the interface. You can import a Neutral file and convert it into a model, or you can do the opposite. First, I'll select the model, open my model \"pipe demo.a,\" and then convert it into a Neutral file. \n\nThe conversion was successful. Let's check it out. This is the Neutral file. It is a text file containing a script that follows a particular syntax described in the Hexagon website's manual. It includes element definitions such as the starting and ending nodes, length along x, y, and z, as well as other characteristics like temperature, pressure, and material. Band definitions are also included, which are referred to by their corresponding numbers in each pipe element. There is a rigid body definition, and the data is recalled using a table. This table corresponds to values based on their assigned numbers. Restraints, definitions, displacements, loads, wind coefficients, allowable stress, environment parameters, and unit definitions are also specified. For example, coordinates are defined for two starting nodes, representing two different pipelines. The text can be modified manually or generated using a Python script. In this case, a Python script was used to automatically generate a model by assigning parametric values. The text file is flexible and can be modified according to your needs. Once modified, it can be converted back to its original format. However, it is important to follow a strict syntax, as the compiler is sensitive to grammar errors. This is the main disadvantage of using the Neutral file. It would be convenient if we could directly import a table from Excel using copy-paste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you explain how the Neutral file is different from other file formats?\n\nThe Neutral file is a text file format that allows for the importation of piping models. Unlike other file formats, such as Excel files, the Neutral file is specifically designed for transferring piping models and includes a script with a defined syntax for element definitions and characteristics.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to directly copy and paste an Excel table into the piping model?\n\nUnfortunately, directly copying and pasting an Excel table into the piping model is not possible. The Neutral file provides a solution for importing and converting the table into a compatible format for the piping model.\n\n\n\nCan the Neutral file be modified manually?\n\nYes, the Neutral file can be modified manually. You can make changes to the element definitions, characteristics, and other parameters according to your specific needs. However, it is important to follow the strict syntax described in the Hexagon website's manual to ensure the file remains compatible with the piping model.\n\n\n\nCan a Python script be used to generate a model using the Neutral file?\n\nYes, a Python script can be used to automatically generate a model by assigning parametric values to the Neutral file. The script can modify the text file according to predefined rules or calculations, providing flexibility in creating and customizing piping models.\n\n\n\nAre there any limitations or drawbacks to using the Neutral file?\n\nOne main drawback of using the Neutral file is the requirement to follow a strict syntax. Any grammar errors or syntax mistakes can cause compatibility issues when converting the file into the piping model. Additionally, manual operations are needed to import and convert the file, which can be time-consuming compared to direct copy-paste methods in other file formats.\n\n\n\nCan the Neutral file be converted", "doc_id": "531c68e1-5fd5-4860-b46e-fab9e797b4ed", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "da3435db494575555e1db9cfd7c50d7c887ba2356f1b819a066c64a953116f95", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4295, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b05ed1c5-c676-47c6-bee0-bf68d83195dc", "3": "4ad57a71-5f6c-41a3-a746-3d439a9e526a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ad57a71-5f6c-41a3-a746-3d439a9e526a": {"__data__": {"text": "methods in other file formats.\n\n\n\nCan the Neutral file be converted back to its original format after modifications?\n\nYes, the modified Neutral file can be converted back to its original format.

As we have seen before, can we change the diameter here? For instance, can I put 4 inches here, and will it be reflected here and here? Then, remember to pay attention to the propagation of properties. In fact, if you want to change the properties only for this element, remember to switch off the properties. Let's set it to 2 inches, et voil\u00e0. Now, if you want to change the table, you can. Let me activate the legend. Of course, you can see all the tables here. And if you need a particular table or a report of all the inputs, you can just press here and go into the element section, for instance. Okay, now you can modify and add any element you want. Just remember that this modification will impact the next element, so be attentive to activating the propagate properties. If you delete this value, then automatically the next elements will have the same diameter. So, in the material section, can I choose from a big database of common materials in piping? Then, let's suppose we receive temperature and pressure calculations for the process. I mean the fluid dynamics properties. Can I insert those values here? For instance, can I insert the fluid density, temperature, and pressure? and in case I want to add the refractory thickness, can I put one millimeter, for example, and specify the density from a faster database? Can I also choose the insulation thickness or cladding thickness, and then select the corresponding insulation or cladding properties? If I don't like some properties, can I hide the material or the five monoliths? But don't worry, trust me, this database is reliable. Now, let's define the first boundary condition that starts the restraints. So, in case I want to apply a boundary condition, can I apply it only at nodes? For example, if I want to add a strain, I select an element, choose the strain option, and specify that I want an anchor at node 10. And if I want to add another support here, can I select this node, activate restraints, and choose, for instance, Y plus? Let me explain it to you. Y plus means that it blocks the movement along the negative Y direction. It's like saying that this pipe is held on a support, resting on a stretch, or whatever, without the ability to fall down.\n\nIn case you want to create a restraint in this element, unfortunately, you have to split it. What does that mean? It means that you need to break this element and choose the division distance. By doing this, you create another element from 10 to 15. 15 becomes the new node, and this new element is the second one, so it has been discretized. Then, at node 15, I define another boundary condition, which is X plus. And if desired, I can also add another boundary condition, which is Y plus. Let me show you another trick. Suppose I have this element and I want to insert a restraint. There is an automatic function called \"Insert a Restraint.\" I choose the distance from 10, let's say 6 meters, to define this restraint. Automatically, I define node 15 and the support I want to add. But remember, if I select this and delete the restraints, the division splitting remains. It's no longer possible to merge this element. If you want to merge, there is a trick. The operation is manual, so you have to remember that the initial element from here to here is a meter. You need to delete this element and instead of saying from 10 to 15, choose 20, and remember to restore the same length. Et voil\u00e0! Also, I want to remind you that if you want to modify some properties here, you are free to do so in this table. This has a suitable temperature for the given case. And since we have been talking about restraints, let me show you the table. In case you are confused about the restraints, you can consult this table and directly modify each restraint you define. You can easily define the same node or add more supports to another node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I insert properties and boundary conditions?\n\nTo insert properties and boundary conditions, you can follow the steps outlined in the previous text.

However, please note that the provided database is reliable and offers trustworthy information.\n\n\n\nHow can I define boundary conditions and restraints?\n\nBoundary conditions and restraints can be defined at nodes. For example, if you want to apply a strain, select an element and choose the strain option. Specify the node where you want to add an anchor or another support, such as Y plus. This selection will block movement along the negative Y direction, effectively holding the pipe on a support without allowing it to fall down.\n\n\n\nIf I want to create a restraint in an element, what should I do?\n\nUnfortunately, creating a restraint in an element requires splitting it. This means breaking the element and choosing the division distance. By doing this, you create a new element from the split point to another node, effectively discretizing it.\n\n\n\nHow can I merge elements if I need to?\n\nIf you want to merge elements, there is a manual trick. First, delete the element you want to merge. Then, instead of specifying the original range, choose a new node number, such as 20.

Let's start with flanges. I will do is break this element from node 40 and add a 100-millimeter length flange. First, I create a new element, as seen here. Then I define it as a rigid body. Now this element becomes a very rigid pipe. I need to determine the mass, which requires consulting the catalogs of flanges. As I select a mass of 40 kilograms, this becomes the flange. From a mechanical standpoint, the flange is considered more rigid than the pipes. Now, let's create the valves. I will demonstrate how to do it. I need to split the element first. This is the first split. Then I split the element here and continue splitting until I reach six splits. From this node, I choose a split length of 600 millimeters. Now I have the first element, which becomes a rigid body. I add a mass of 100 kilograms. Here you can see the representation of the valves. If you want to save time in modeling, there is another trick. Let me revert this back to a normal pipe with all the defined characteristics. Now I will delay this rigid body definition. Okay, now we are back to a normal pipe. There is an option called \"Valve Flanges Database.\" First, select the element you want to transform into a valve or flange. Then select from the database of flanges and valves in the market. Choose the dimensions and characteristics from the catalog, and it will automatically define the rigid body and corresponding mass. For example, if I want to add a gate valve or a flange, or choose a thread or socket connection, I select the desired options from the class. The valve is automatically created. The same applies to flanges. In the database, select flanges, define the characteristics, and it will create them automatically. There is also a feature for creating automatic splitting. For instance, if I want to create a flange from here to here, instead of selecting all the elements, I select from the end and define the flange. Now it is correct, and you can see that the element is automatically divided, creating a new split element.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I create flanges and valves in the model?\n\nTo create flanges, you can break the element and specify the length of the flange. Then, define it as a rigid body and determine the mass. For valves, you need to split the element and assign a length to each split. Define them as rigid bodies and assign the corresponding mass. Alternatively, you can use the Valve Flanges Database option to transform elements into valves or flanges automatically.\n\n\n\nCan I change the dimensions of the flanges and valves?\n\nYes, you can choose the dimensions and characteristics of the flanges and valves from the catalog provided in the Valve Flanges Database.

Let's start with the process calculation provided by the process department, which includes flow temperature, properties, and pressure. In this pipe, for example, I want to insert a fluid with a temperature of 400 degrees. I can also define other temperatures that I expect the fluid to have. For temperature, remember to check the ambient temperature condition, which is the reference temperature at which thermal expansion is zero. In this case, the ambient temperature is set to 21 degrees. Why do we consider different boundary conditions and temperature values? The same applies to pressure. I can choose 1000 kcal for the operating pressure, and this is known as the hydrostatic test. The hydrostatic test involves applying pressurized water to the pipe to check its resistance. You can refer to the table to see how these values are propagated from one element to the next in terms of temperature and pressure. If you don't want to propagate these properties extensively and prefer to keep them specific to certain pipes, you can enter zero for the subsequent pipe in the table. This means that the pressure of 1000 kcal will only be applied to the second and third elements, but not the next ones. Alternatively, you can choose to disable the propagation of properties by unchecking the corresponding option. This way, you can freely apply 2000 degrees and the specified pressure only to the selected element without propagating them to the following ones. In another video, we will explore how to integrate these properties and boundary conditions to create load cases for evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I define the ambient temperature for the pipe?\n\nThe ambient temperature is the reference temperature at which thermal expansion is zero. To define the ambient temperature for the pipe, you need to go to the corresponding section and check the condition specified for it. In this case, the ambient temperature is set to 21 degrees.\n\n\n\nCan I apply different temperature values to different pipes?\n\nYes, you can apply different temperature values to specific pipes. In the table provided, you can navigate to the desired pipe and input the desired temperature. This way, the specified temperature will be applied only to that particular pipe, and it won't propagate to the subsequent ones.\n\n\n\nHow does the propagation of properties work for temperature and pressure?\n\nThe propagation of properties refers to how temperature and pressure values are carried over from one pipe element to the next. By default, the values are automatically propagated based on the connected elements. However, if you want to limit the propagation and keep specific properties in certain pipes, you can manually modify the values in the table accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I disable the propagation of properties?\n\nTo disable the propagation of properties, you can uncheck the corresponding option in the settings.

In the table, you can navigate to the desired element and input the desired pressure. This allows you to apply different pressure values to specific elements while keeping them separate from the next ones.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of the hydrostatic test mentioned?\n\nThe hydrostatic test is a test performed using pressurized water on the pipe to assess its resistance. It helps ensure that the pipe can withstand the specified pressure without any issues.

These forces need to be considered and applied as additional forces at the bend. The magnitude of these forces can be determined using the following formula: DLF, which stands for the Load Factor, is typically equal to rho (fluid density) multiplied by V (fluid velocity) multiplied by A (cross-sectional area of the pipe) multiplied by theta (the angle or angular space of the bend).\n\nIf you want to include these slug forces in a static analysis, you need to manually apply them as nodal forces at the bend or change of direction. Let's see how to do it. Suppose we have a pipe with a given fluid density, and we want to apply slug load at a specific location. We can directly apply the nodal forces at that location, considering the desired force components along the x and z axes. However, it's important to note that the absence of a visible bend in the illustration may raise questions. For the purpose of this lesson, I will create a bend. Please note that the radius may not be accurately represented here, but that is not a concern for now\n\nAdditional nodes are automatically created, including the medium angle in the middle of the bend. At the desired position, such as node 59, we can apply the calculated forces using the scissor tool. To demonstrate this, I will now use Python and Anaconda to perform the calculations. Assuming a fluid velocity of 10 meters per second and having manually determined the cross-sectional area, I can calculate the force in Newtons. Then, I will input this force component along the z-axis and the corresponding force component along the y-axis, remembering to apply a negative sign for the direction. Voila! This is the slug load that I have applied, consisting of these force components. Finally, we obtain the total force component along the desired direction.\n\nIt's important to note that this manual process requires the user to carefully select and calculate the magnitude of each force and ensure that the forces are applied in the same plane as the bend.

Seeing if the structural arrangements are possible from an exhibition point of view will then be possible. Being able to see this stuff visually will help you get a better feel for the model. All of the loads of the existing structure will be easy to view, for example. Modifications can easily be made. More accurate estimates will also be given by the program. Now you can just run the same model for analysis and get certain results, which give you better confidence in the content you are considering for your estimate. For example, if your structure or piping fails due to the modification of loads, then you will get some fair idea by what percent you are failing. According to the analysis, you can just define certain additional quantities for the estimate. And if you have more time to look through the analysis, then certain small modifications can be made based on your experience and get better estimates for your structure. As a demonstration of how to do such things, we will consider a small plant layout, which will consist of one stack, three pipe racks, and an open frame. So let's start with the three pipe rack model, where we begin with a simple single pipe rack that we have. I will just open the pipe rack. So this is the pipe rack that we have. Now I have assumed an overall layout, for which I have created one grid layout. Let me just load that grid layout through the settings. The surface can be chosen to be displayed as either on or off over here. I will keep it on to more easily see the reference distances. Now I will load an existing grid layout that I have already created. Now that I have done this, I will quickly explain what this grid layout is. \n\nSo, this is the place for the open frame. Here there will be one rack, but I will be shifting the existing rack over here. Then there will be another rack over here and one pipe rack over there. There will be one flare stack over here. So this is the project we are considering. I will begin by shifting the first pipe rack to its required position. It starts from the origin here. Here it goes through 3 meters, and we will take it to 8 meters. I will start working on making changes under the Edit and then Move tab. First, I must choose which model I want to move. I want the columns to be here, so I will move it 1 meter in the x direction. I also want to move it by negative 8 meters in the y direction. After I input my desired values, I press the Move button. So now the pipe rack is in the desired position. Now I want to create a copy of this pipe rack. The current pipe rack's furthest point is 11 meters away from the origin in the z direction. I will make a copy of the pipe rack at 33 meters away from the origin. After I change the location where I want the copy to be, I simply press the Copy button, and the structure will be copied to the desired location. When the Copy button is clicked, it will ask whether the loads should be copied or not. I will choose to do so. So here you can see that we have the pipe rack where we want it to be. I will make another copy of the original model, which will only be shifted by 1 meter in the x direction. Once again, it will ask me if I want to copy the loads when I hit Copy.\n\nEvery time a copy is created, a new pipe rack gets added to this dropdown bar. So why did I make a copy here? It's because I want to route it and then place the pipe rack in this direction. Now let's rotate the PR3 pipe rack. I will rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. For the center of rotation, I will use these values. After entering the values, PR3 will be rotated accordingly. I also want to shift PR3 by 6 meters in this direction. To do this, I go back to the Move/Copy tab. Here, I will input how much I want to move PR3 after selecting it. Currently, the Z value is at 11 meters, but I want it at 5 meters, so I'll just change the value. As you can see, everything has been placed as I wanted it. So now we have three different pipe racks that are not connected to each other with a gap of 1 meter between them. I will now check the natural frequency of all of them.

Since the pipe racks are just copies of each other, the natural frequencies will be the same for all of them, which is 4.342. Now, before moving on to further reports, let's try to combine this model with an open frame model and a stack model. To do this, I go to the Open Frame module. After logging in again, I go to Structure and open the existing Open Frame module that I have already created. I will lower the platform transparency so it's easier to see what's going on in the model. We have several members and platforms already. \n\nNow we will replicate those grid lines. Under the Settings tab, we go to Grids and import some user-defined grids. Now the grid lines will be shown. The structure is already in the correct location. There is a missing grid at FNG-dash. I will quickly create one there. I make the modification under User Defined Grids by selecting which grid I want to modify. I will also change the names of these grids for the pipe rack. I will remove the overall matte grid and keep the user-defined grids. Now I will import our pipe rack module here. After importing its file, the pipe rack is now in the same project as this structure. Similarly, we can bring in the flare. I have already created a flare, which I will simply attach in the XREF tab. So here is the flare. You can see the flare pipe nozzle here. This is how we get the overall plant layout. It can be used for different purposes. As mentioned earlier, it can be used for a small estimate. You can also use it to create your piping layout. For example, it can be helpful if you have a pipe that needs to start at this flare and go along these pipe racks to reach this open frame structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to check the natural frequency of the pipe racks?\n\nChecking the natural frequency of the pipe racks is important to avoid resonance effects and vibration problems in the future. It helps us understand if the structural arrangements are possible and if they can withstand external forces such as wind or seismic events.\n\n\n\nHow does visualizing the model help in estimating and making modifications?\n\nVisualizing the model allows us to get a better understanding of the entire layout and helps us assess the feasibility of structural arrangements.

It helps in evaluating the spatial relationships between different components and enables better planning for piping layouts. It also aids in estimating and understanding how pipes can be routed through the pipe racks to reach the open frame structure or other parts of the plant.\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of replicating the grid lines and modifying the grids?\n\nReplicating the grid lines helps maintain consistency and alignment across different modules.

What is a reducer? A reducer is used to connect pipelines with different diameters. So, suppose you have a pipeline with one diameter and you want to connect it to another pipeline with different dimensions. The solution is a reducer.\n\nOf course, the reducer can be used as a nozzle itself to connect pipelines, or it can be used as a diffuser. It depends on the velocity of the fluids and the flow Mach number.\n\nNormally, you use a reducer when you want to adapt different pipelines or change the diameter to meet the hydraulic requirements of industrial plants. It can also be used when you have different pipes in your inventory and you want to connect them to a pump with a different interface. That's why reducers are crucially important.\n\nBasically, reducers can be divided into concentric and eccentric types. They are categorized as concentric or eccentric. In the concentric type, the larger and smaller diameters share the same axis. In the eccentric type, the axes are slightly shifted.\n\nEach type has its advantages. Concentric reducers are usually used to connect pipelines to pumps and are useful for transporting slurries or abrasive liquids. They help alleviate cavitation and protect the components. On the other hand, eccentric reducers have other advantages. For example, they can help maintain the same top or bottom level of the pipeline and reducer. They require additional support but are employed for transporting fluid in horizontal lines with the assistance of gravity. They also reduce noise and vibration, require less installation space, and minimize turbulence and material entrapment.\n\nWhen designing a pipeline connected to a pump to avoid cavitation, reducers are preferred, especially eccentric reducers, particularly those with flat sides. However, this is a specific case.\n\nReducers are also classified based on their connection to the pipe. There are butt-welded reducers, which are connected to the pipe through welding. The chamfer is used to facilitate the welding process, and once the pipes are joined, it is difficult to remove them. Screwed connections are another type, where the pipe is threaded and screwed into the reducer. Alternatively, pipes can be connected to the pipeline using flanges and screws. Another type is the socket weld, which is a cylindrical body with holes to accommodate pipes with different diameters. The outer diameter of the pipe is slightly smaller than the hole diameter in the socket, and welding is used to connect them. The standards and dimensions of socket weld reducers are similar to those of sockets.\n\nDifferent materials, such as carbon steel, alloy, and stainless steel, are used for constructing piping reducers.\n\nNo, carbon steel is very resistant. It is a good material, but it is susceptible or vulnerable to corrosion. So, pay attention when you have to transport highly corrosive or reactive fluids. In the market, you can find carbon steel, which follows all the material standards. Additionally, there are stainless steel, alloy steel, duplex steel, and, for specific cases, nickel can be employed.\n\nNow let's move on to the modeling of pipe reducers. To define a reducer, you start with a normal pipe size and element. Then, you select the reducer option to transform it into a reducer. This involves defining the starting diameter (diameter one) and the final diameter (diameter two), as well as the starting thickness and final thickness. Alpha represents the inclination of the conical portion. If alpha is defined, it determines the length of the slope. If alpha is left blank, the software assumes that the length of the slope is 60% of the entire length of the reducer and automatically calculates alpha.\n\nThere is a range to define alpha if the user wants to specify it. The maximum value for alpha is 60 degrees, and there is also a minimum value where the slope extends", "doc_id": "7ecf323d-5563-4cb8-8fac-e7bbc1d82f51", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "36e72891ef8f098f7b86a306b0e287e0374fde4526994cbeb9f9f549e444f819", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4055, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "28ba1a81-2dec-42be-8463-6043527b8691", "3": "8a158cff-044c-405f-a3c5-bf33ba4f2740"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a158cff-044c-405f-a3c5-bf33ba4f2740": {"__data__": {"text": "for alpha is 60 degrees, and there is also a minimum value where the slope extends throughout the entire element, without a straight portion. By activating the code IGTD12, you can introduce arc one and arc two, which represent the smooth transition between the straight portion and the conical slope.\n\nSuppose you need to connect a pipe with different diameters and thicknesses. In between, you create an intermediate element, which is the reducer. The starting diameter is assumed to be the same as that of the previous element. When creating this element, ensure that the diameter is identical to the previous one. If the diameter two and thickness two are left blank, they automatically take the size and dimensions of the next pipe element.\n\nIf you declare another pipe element, you are free to do so, although it may not be realistic. The declaration of alpha is optional, depending on your needs. If alpha is not declared, it is assumed that the slope of the conical portion is 60% of the entire length of the reducer. Graphically, the element always appears as a full conical shape, regardless of the angle chosen. However, behind the scenes, it is discretized into 10 straight pipe elements.\n\nIn the discretization, the conical element is divided into 10 straight pipe elements, where the diameter progressively decreases step by step. The thickness also varies while the diameter decreases.\n\nOf course, regardless of the presence of straight portions, such as the first two elements in this case, and their identical diameters, you will still see a full conical representation of the element from a graphical point of view.\n\nNow, let's see how to discretize an eccentric reducer. Creating an eccentric reducer requires a manual operation where you set up a geometrical offset to match the shift from the larger diameter to the smaller diameter. Ultimately, you define an inclined element that corresponds to the previous one. By adjusting this offset, you determine the end position of the smaller diameter pipe.\n\nThe discretization process remains the same as described before, with a stepwise discretization of the conical portion. The only difference is that this portion of the reducer is inclined, meaning that the main axis is tilted.\n\nLet's calculate the offset manually considering the given diameters. Diameter two is equal to 4.2, and diameter one is 2.73. Subtracting diameter two from diameter one and dividing by two gives us the offset. We apply this offset to achieve the desired shift. By aligning the bottom line support and adjusting the shifting, we define the eccentric reducer.\n\nSuppose we want to place supports at the same level here and here, making it straightforward to do so now.

The correct selection of pipe wall thickness and supports guarantees its structural stability. Supports are designed to bear the weight of the pipeline, including components such as line props, insulation, refractory material, and external factors like snow. Additionally, restraints are utilized to restrict pipe movement in specific directions or control certain types of motion, such as resisting occasional loads from wind or earthquakes. Some restraints are employed to protect sensitive equipment, increase stiffness, or reduce vibration. In computer analysis, pipe elements consist of nodes, each with six degrees of freedom. By applying restraints, certain displacements can be blocked or limited, while others may be allowed but constrained by stiffness. We will delve into the details of these supports and restraints.\n\nLet's begin with the anchor, which is the simplest form of support or restraint. An anchor completely fixes the pipe, meaning all six degrees of freedom are restricted. In the case of a pipe connected to equipment, such as a flange, the equipment can be considered an anchor that restricts all degrees of freedom. In finite element analysis, as the equipment is not entirely rigid, a certain level of stiffness can be assumed or imposed to simulate the restraint. This implies that some movements are permitted but with a specific stiffness, resembling a spring-like behavior of the support. In reality, most supports possess some level of stiffness.\n\nDifferent connection methods can be used for pipes, such as anchor trunnions or anchor rings attached to a background structure. In cases where underground pipes are buried, flanges can be constructed to encase and immobilize the pipes entirely. In these scenarios, all movement is impeded. Let's move on to the next slide and examine the details of supports.\n\nSupports are employed to sustain a portion of the pipe system's weight and resist vertical loads. Various strategies are utilized, such as hangers, which act as springs and support the weight of the pipe by lifting it off the structure. Alternatively, the pipe may simply be laid down on a supporting structure without additional attachments. Pipe shoes are used to isolate the pipe and lay it on the supporting structure when necessary. For high-temperature applications, such as when the pipe exceeds 400 degrees Celsius, trunnion shoes or clamp shoes are employed to provide the necessary support.\n\nThese support options provide better isolation. Alternatively, we can utilize saddle supports or ring grinders, particularly for pipes larger than 24 inches in diameter. In pipe stress analysis, hangers and supports are employed to prevent movement in the vertical direction, denoted as the y-direction. The objective is to ensure the pipe does not fall downward. Therefore, we restrict both upward and downward vertical movement, or solely block downward movement while allowing upward motion. Hangers play a significant role in this category. They support a portion of the pipe system's weight and handle superimposed vertical loads. Hangers primarily operate in tension, minimizing the likelihood of buckling. They are suspended from a structure at fixed points, such as a beam, a ceiling, or a wall. When the pipe undergoes thermal expansion or encounters other forces, the hangers tilt, generating horizontal resistance limited to a maximum of 4 degrees. Axial movement is typically disregarded in the analysis, with emphasis on the permitted horizontal movement. To reduce horizontal resistance, hangers are often initially inclined or slanted. This ensures that the pipe experiences minimal axial resistance during expansion. In the industry, specific stiffness is incorporated into some hanger designs. Instead of being rigid, they possess a degree of flexibility to support the dead load and accommodate thermal expansion, providing support for any expansion that may occur.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of supports and restraints in pipe stress analysis?\n\nThe supports and restraints in pipe stress analysis are crucial for ensuring the integrity and stability of the piping system.

They are typically suspended from a structure and work in tension, preventing the pipe from falling downward. Hangers can be designed as springs or flexible elements that accommodate thermal expansion.\n\n\n\nCan you explain the significance of initial inclination or slanting in hangers?\n\nInitial inclination or slanting of hangers is employed to reduce the horizontal resistance imposed on the pipe during thermal expansion. By providing an angled orientation, the hangers allow for horizontal movement without significant axial resistance, ensuring proper expansion and contraction of the pipe.\n\n\n\nAre there any specialized hanger designs that offer specific stiffness?\n\nYes, in some cases, hanger designs incorporate specific stiffness.

This ensures that the pipe is adequately supported regardless of the expansion that occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does thermal expansion affect the movement of pipes and the role of supports?\n\nThermal expansion causes pipes to expand or contract due to temperature changes. This expansion can exert forces on the supports and restraints. Proper support design considers the expected thermal expansion and provides flexibility or allowances for the movement to prevent excessive stress on the pipe and its components.\n\n\n\nIs axial movement considered in pipe stress analysis?\n\nIn pipe stress analysis, axial movement is typically neglected or assumed to be minimal.

In fact, there are various types of restraints, including struts, stops, guides, and more. Let's go through them in detail.\n\nFirst, let's talk about struts. Struts are directional restraints that can work in compression, tension, or both. They consist of a compressive column with two rotational joints.\n\nNext, we have stops. Stops are used to halt pipe movement in one or more translation directions. They can limit axial movement by either creating a gap between the support and the line stops or by using line stops that restrict movement within a certain range.\n\nGuide blocks, on the other hand, support the pipe vertically while preventing lateral displacement. They can be enhanced with one-way stops to restrict lateral movement in one direction, ensuring proper positioning and resistance against forces like earthquakes or wind.\n\nAnother type of restraint is the brace, which is similar to the strut but specifically designed to resist occasional loads and reduce vibration. It is commonly attached to a pre-compressed spring, and its resistance curve shows an initial resistance range followed by a linear slope. The brace doesn't require initial movement to activate its stopping action.\n\nModeling braces can be challenging due to their nonlinear behavior. Software like Caesar provides specific boundary conditions to accurately model the translational double-acting bilinear behavior of a brace. Alternatively, a combination of a nonlinear restraint and a linear spring can be used to simulate a similar behavior in modeling tools like IDS.\n\nMoving on to other types of supports, we have sliding supports and rigid supports. Sliding supports allow the pipe to slide on a stretcher, experiencing only friction resistance during movement. Rigid supports, on the other hand, secure the pipe in place by clamping it to the stretcher.\n\nFor accommodating thermal expansion, spring supports can be used.

If the sustained stress meets the code requirements, then the support system is considered acceptable. Computerized stress analysis is based on this criterion. If the sustained stress is within the allowable limit, it does not matter how often the pipe is supported. However, there are other considerations that require setting the allowable support spans for horizontal lines. I will now explain some of these concerns. For instance, the support location is typically determined before analyzing the piping system to ensure acceptable stress levels. Therefore, the layout and positioning of each support are crucial and will impact the final stress. Layout designers must follow certain rules to ensure safe stress levels. Now, why do we install supports? One reason is to limit displacement and prevent excessive pocketing. By limiting displacement, we also avoid interference between different pipe lines and minimize rotations, thereby providing rigidity and reducing undesirable vibrations. Fortunately, the code provides formulas and guidelines to determine the ideal support spacing, which helps engineers ensure that sustained stress due to the weight does not exceed allowable limits. \n\nLet's consider an example of resting supports, where the pipe is laid on a structure. The analysis of such supports is not straightforward; it becomes nonlinear, and obtaining an accurate solution is challenging. Different approaches have been developed to address this problem. Now, let's examine a specific example. We have a pipeline connected to equipment, such as a tower and a flange, and resting supports are used. These supports are nonlinear as the pipe is simply placed on the structure. Now, suppose that during operating conditions, the temperature increases, causing the tower to move vertically. As a result, the flange moves upward, lifting the pipe. When the pipe is lifted, the restraints provided by the supports are no longer effective, and only the specific support shown in the example is active. The total dead weight is absorbed by this support and the one at the equipment location. The elevated temperature is maintained for a certain period, during which relaxation occurs. This means that the initially lifted pipe gradually relaxes and displaces downward. Now, let's consider the system cooling down. The piping returns to its original position, but it makes contact with the support before reaching the cooled temperature. Additionally, during relaxation, the sustained stress caused by the weight is alleviated.\n\nI mean, it was significantly reduced. However, when we cool down the structure, the pipe comes into contact with the supporting surface before fully reaching it. And then, we will start, and we will see. I mean, the pipe will experience thermal expansion stress due to the reversed relaxation compared to the operating conditions, caused by the support's stopping action. This will result in unpredictable high loads and stresses at the tower connection. Therefore, we need to consider both sustained stress and thermal expansion in the analysis, taking into account the nonlinear behavior of the support. Now, let's discuss three main approaches used in computer analysis.\n\nThe first approach, known as the general straightforward approach, involves calculating sustained stress and expansion stress separately without considering the support situation. In the first analysis, we calculate the stress with weight, pressure, and sustained loads. Then, we perform another analysis considering only the temperature expansion, without imposing weight and pressure. In the first analysis, all supports are assumed to be active, while in the temperature expansion analysis, only the supports that lift off are activated. However, this approach may raise questions because we are not considering the weight during the temperature analysis, which could lead to underestimation of expansion stress.\n\n\n\nThe second approach is the algebraic substructure approach, commonly used in Caesar 2. In this analysis, we first perform a sustained analysis with weight, pressure, and all supports active. Then, we conduct another analysis under operating conditions, considering thermal expansion along with weight and pressure. If a pipe is lifted off, the supports in contact with it are not considered in the analysis.

Then, we verify which supports are active based on this analysis. Next, we perform two independent analyses: one for sustained loads and another for expansion stress. In this case, we consider the activation of supports in a dependent manner, starting from the first analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of analyzing sustained stress and expansion stress separately in the general straightforward approach?\n\nThe purpose of analyzing sustained stress and expansion stress separately in the general straightforward approach is to evaluate the individual contributions of these stress components to the overall behavior of the piping system. By analyzing them separately, we can determine the effects of sustained loads (such as weight and pressure) and thermal expansion on the system's stress levels. This approach helps in understanding the different factors influencing the system's performance and allows for better assessment and design of the support system.\n\n\n\nWhat are the limitations of the algebraic substructure approach in analyzing thermal expansion stress?\n\nThe algebraic substructure approach has some limitations when it comes to analyzing thermal expansion stress. One of the main limitations is that it does not consider the complete directional movement of thermal expansion in operating conditions. The approach assumes a simple algebraic subtraction to calculate the expansion stress, without considering potential opposing movements or stresses that may occur.

Then, in the subsequent analyses for sustained loads and expansion stress, we consider the activation of supports in relation to their dependency on the initial analysis.

In the latter case, we typically opt for rigid struts or hangers for support. Alternatively, if there is a tall vessel, a riser can be defined starting from that point and descending along the equipment, and in such cases, supports can be directly fixed into the structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is special carefulness needed for the vertical portion of a pipeline?\n\nSpecial carefulness is required for the vertical portion of a pipeline because it experiences significant vertical expansion, which is concentrated at a single point. This concentration of expansion can lead to high stresses and potential structural issues, making it important to handle and support the vertical pipeline properly.\n\n\n\nWhat are the different ways in which a riser can be supported?\n\nA riser can be supported in various ways. It can be hung directly underneath equipment using hangers. Alternatively, it can be connected to different horizontal lines, and in this case, rigid struts or hangers are commonly used for support. Another option is to define a riser starting from a tall vessel and descending along the equipment, with supports directly fixed into the structure.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of using hangars or rigid struts for riser support?\n\nHangars and rigid struts are used for riser support to provide stability and prevent excessive movement. They help maintain the vertical alignment of the riser, ensuring that it can withstand the vertical expansion and other dynamic forces. By securely supporting the riser, hangars and rigid struts help prevent damage and ensure the safe operation of the pipeline.", "doc_id": "9b0f6e6d-a351-4714-814d-bf32dd08c1a5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5d9c13f81c677e51a421e9d15d5ea16c7531ceca857ebcfaaac241f20e23d2ec", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2078, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f2f5d2d8-4d0f-491c-8747-8a39c3cfa6f3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c175f72-8adb-4df5-b86c-a697894f488f": {"__data__": {"text": "The T-junctions are crucial components of the pipeline system. Despite their small size, they play a significant role in dividing or combining flow in pipelines. They can also be used to mix different liquids, liquids and gases, or different gases. Construction companies offer various shapes and dimensions, resulting in a wide range of catalogs available in the market.\n\nModeling a T-junction is relatively straightforward using pipe elements. The branch and main pipe can be discretized using beam elements. The flexibility factor, fortunately, is equal to 1 according to the B31.1 code. However, since the T-junction causes stress concentration, the stress intensity factor must be applied in stress calculations. This factor depends on factors such as shape, intersection, dimensions, presence of welding or flanges, and other connections.\n\nTo model a T-junction, you can create pipe elements to represent the main branch and the main pipe. Another branch can be started from a specific node with a different diameter. Selecting the \"stress intensity factor\" option allows for stress calculations specific to the T-junction. The intersection node, type of T-junction (16 types available), and other parameters can be defined. The stress intensity factor can be automatically evaluated based on the code or manually defined by the user.\n\nIf there is uncertainty or missing data, consulting the manufacturer's catalogs is recommended. The stress intensity factor is a critical aspect that can be defined or calculated. Additionally, the \"intersection stress intensity checking\" option allows for the automatic calculation and testing of different stress intensity factor combinations to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow important are T-junctions in a pipeline system?\n\nT-junctions play a crucial role in dividing or combining flow in pipelines. They are essential for controlling the direction and distribution of fluids or gases within the pipeline system.\n\n\n\nCan T-junctions be used for mixing different types of fluids or gases?\n\nYes, T-junctions are commonly used for mixing different liquids, liquids and gases, or different gases. They provide a convenient point of interaction where the substances can be blended or combined as needed.\n\n\n\nHow are T-junctions modeled in pipeline analysis?\n\nT-junctions can be modeled using pipe elements and beam elements. The main branch and main pipe are discretized using beam elements, while additional branches are represented by pipe elements with different diameters. This modeling approach allows for accurate stress calculations and analysis of the T-junction's behavior.\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the stress intensity factor in T-junction analysis?\n\nThe stress intensity factor is crucial in T-junction analysis because T-junctions often cause stress concentration due to the intersection and the presence of different connections. The stress intensity factor helps account for this concentration and ensures accurate stress calculations for the T-junction.\n\n\n\nHow can the stress intensity factor be determined?\n\nThe stress intensity factor can be determined in two ways. First, it can be automatically evaluated based on the code used for analysis. Alternatively, the user can manually define the stress intensity factor based on factors such as shape, intersection, dimensions, welding or flanges, and other connections. Consulting manufacturer catalogs can also provide valuable information for determining the stress intensity factor.\n\n\n\nAre there different types of T-junctions available in the market?\n\nYes, there are various types of T-junctions available in the market. Different manufacturers offer catalogs with a wide range of shapes and dimensions to suit different pipeline system requirements. Users can choose the appropriate type of T-junction based on their specific needs.\n\n\n\nHow can the accuracy of stress calculations for T-junctions be ensured?\n\nTo ensure accuracy in stress calculations, it is important to consult manufacturer catalogs for missing data or uncertainties. Additionally, the \"intersection stress intensity checking\" option in the analysis software allows for the automatic calculation and testing of different stress intensity factor combinations, helping to verify the accuracy of the calculations.", "doc_id": "5c175f72-8adb-4df5-b86c-a697894f488f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "499a46e8911165fcb7f47716ab47e34ffb662582f85705374ea376c2c98bc1d2",
